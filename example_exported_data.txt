%X Online retailing has been an important channel or business model for many firms in China. How to win, satisfy and retain customers has become the urgent practical problem to solve in front of the online retailers. Based on the theory of reasoned action, an empirical study of factors influencing consumers’ repurchase is conducted by using the questionnaire survey method. The results indicate that in the setting of platform online retail, consumer repurchase intention is significantly affected by consumer satisfaction, consumer satisfaction is positively and significantly affected by product quality and price, but not by website design, information quality, order fulfillment, and consumer service quality. So platform online retailers should reasonably allocate marketing resources accordingly, and pay attention to improve customer satisfaction by controlling product quality and enhance price advantage of product.

%X This study examines whether perceived psychological contract and perceived fairness can serve as mediators between certain website design features (retailer guarantees and seals of approval guarantees) and perceived trust and risk beliefs. Based on the psychological contract theory and organizational justice theory, this research would examine the nomological validities of perceived psychological contract and perceived fairness in business-to-consumer e-commerce context. The results could demonstrate how perceived trust and perceived risk can be influenced by certain design features, and help online retailers improve their website design and business practices.

%X Intense competition among online retailers and high customer expectations drive product returns, which eat into online retailers´ profits. Thus, online retailers need to find ways to reduce return rates without causing a concomitant decrease in sales. Using a grounded theory approach which combines literature-based insights and in-depth qualitative interviews with managers from major online retailers, the authors propose a framework for understanding the antecedents of the decision to implement a product returns management system (PRMS). In addition, the framework considers three types of preventive instruments online retailers employ to reduce product return rates as well as moderators of the linkage between the decision to implement a PRMS and the chosen instruments type. The authors conclude with a brief discussion of future research directions.

%X Product returns are a major challenge in e-commerce that severely affect the economic and ecological sustainability of the industry. While many static one-size-fits-all approaches to limit product returns have been proposed, there is a gap in the literature regarding strategies based on individual consumption patterns. We introduce a decision support system for the prediction of product returns, including a new approach for large-scale feature extraction. This system can be used as the basis for a returns strategy that allows online retailers to intervene before problematic transactions even take place. Using a dataset containing 1,149,262 purchases obtained from a major German online retailer, we demonstrate that our decision support system can identify consumption patterns associated with a high product return rate at sufficient accuracy for such a strategy to be feasible. We also show that the system outperforms a wide selection of state-of-the art classification and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

%X A novel omnichannel service concept was developed and piloted in the context of everyday retail service environment. A starting point for the new service was a need to provide the customers of a small rural retail store with wider selection of goods through integrating web shopping interface to the store’s service processes. One of the driving design principles was to achieve a seamless service experience by a fusion of web and physical retail channels. The findings from the case study were analysed from the viewpoint of store customers and personnel. Over half of the interviewed customers stated they were likely to use the novel retail service in the future. Previous experience with online shopping appeared to have a direct, positive effect on the customers’ willingness to adopt the service into use. The hands-on demonstration was proved to be an advantageous way for introducing the novel service to potential users. Personnel’s attitudes towards the service concept were in general enthusiastic and positive; however the service also invoked some initial concerns mostly related to additional work load. The personnel also clearly appreciated the positive effects of the new service on the store and customers.

Therefore, the core functionalities of a dynamic pricing system are investigated using single case study research method. They embrace both external and internal factors for price calculation. First, there are functions to get external information such as price information from competing retailers. They provide important information for calculation and forecasting. Second, internal oriented functions exist, which analyse personal information such as the birthday in order to influence the buyers’ decisions in a positive way.

%X This research aims to explore the impact of culture on online retailing stores across three Asian countries. Hofstede’s culture theory has been used as the theoretical foundation. After reviewing four culture dimensions including individualism-collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity-femininity, we investigated the potential cultural impact on three online retailing stores from China, India, and Thailand, respectively. We compared the website design, primary offerings, major features, communication channels, and payment methods across three cases in order to see if cultural difference could explain the variations. The analysis shows that cultural differences lead to diverse feature design and payment method among these stores. In addition, trust, brand image, and value-added perception play an essential role when consumers make purchasing. Moreover, cultural dimensions such as large power distance and uncertainty avoidance seem to be a barrier against people’s intention to shop online. The results suggest practitioners consider cultural factors when designing online retailing stores. The results also provide a starting point for researchers to further investigate the impact of specific cultural factors on online store design and consumer behavior.

%X Access to the internet from public places has further strengthened the internet as an anywhere-everywhere concept. Globally more businesses offer free public Wi-Fi for their customers. This research looks at customer attitude towards the use of free public Wi-Fi for e-commerce transactions, specifically, how does trust of the free public internet influence customer perception of the security of the e-commerce retailer websites. We conduct a brief study of participants in both the US and India on their perceptions of conducting e-commerce transactions using free public Wi-Fi. Our results show that the trust of the free public internet is a significant predictor of perceived security of the e-commerce website. Encrypted connections notwithstanding, businesses may need to stress the message that their website is safe to transact over public Wi-Fi.

%X E-commerce service failures have been the bane of e-commerce, compelling customers to either abandon transactions entirely or switch to traditional brick-and-mortar establishments. Yet, there is a paucity of studies that investigates how such failures manifest on e-commerce websites and their impact on consumers. This paper, therefore, synthesizes extant literature on e-service and system success to arrive at a novel classification system that delineates e-commerce service failures into information, functional, and system categories, each with its own set of constituent dimensions. Extending expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT), we further distinguish among disconfirmed outcome, process, and cost expectancies as major consequences of e-commerce service failures. A theoretical model of e-commerce service failure classifications and their consequences was constructed together with testable propositions that relate the three failure categories to consumers’ disconfirmed expectancies. Finally, we explore the validity of our theoretical model based on descriptive accounts of actual occurrences of e-commerce service failures and their corresponding consequences. Consistent with our theoretical model, information and functional failures were found to be associated with disconfirmed outcome and process expectancies respectively. System failures, on the other hand, do not affect consumers’ disconfirmed expectancies, thereby contradicting our predictions. Post hoc analysis on constituent dimensions of information, functional, and system failures yielded additional insights on the preceding observations.

%X Electronic commerce has grown rapidly in recent years.  However, surveys of online customers continue to indicate that many remain unsatisfied with their online purchase experiences.  Clearly, more research is needed to better understand what affects customers’ evaluations of their online experiences.  Through a large dataset gathered from two online websites, this study investigates the importance of product uncertainty and retailer visibility in customers’ online purchase decisions, as well as the mitigating effects of retailer characteristics. We find that high product uncertainty and low retailer visibility have a negative impact on customer satisfaction.  However, a retailer’s service quality, website design, and pricing play important roles in mitigating the negative impact of high product uncertainty and low retailer visibility.  Specifically, service quality can mitigate the negative impacts of low retailer visibility and high product uncertainty in online markets.  Website design, on the other hand, helps to reduce the impact of product uncertainty when experience goods are involved.

But transforming to fully digital services requires an organization to acquire specific capabilities. This article presents a digital services capability model that allows an organization to assess its current capabilities and identify gaps. Two in-depth case studies demonstrate the application of the model and show how it identifies the capabilities in urgent need of improvement. Our recommendations are built around four scenarios for using the model.Click here for podcast summary (mp3) Click here for free 2-page executive summary (pdf)Click here for free presentation slides (pdf)

%X One of the prominent segments of mobile commerce is the mobile application market, where consumers download applications from an app store. Importantly, prior work showed that user behavior in mobile settings is substantially different than user behavior in PC settings, and therefore needs to be better understood. In this research, we study for the first time the predictive power of consumer engagement in such mobile settings. Using data from a leading commercial A/B testing platform specializing in app store design, we perform both in-sample assessment and predictive capacity evaluation of prediction models of app store conversion based on engagement information. Our findings show that in mobile settings, engagement-based models are highly informative for predicting conversion, and are consistent across different prediction methods (logistic regression, classification tree, and random forest). These findings indicate that engagement analytics may enhance our understanding of app conversion process.

%X Website customer loyalty is believed to be very important to the success of E-Commerce firms. Based on document review, this study constructs a customer loyalty effect model which chooses organization, navigation, labeling and searching system as dependent variables as well as attitude and behavior loyalty as variables. The sample of the study was drawn from 250 students who have online shopping experience, 202 of usable questionnaires were included in the data analysis. Data analyses using correlation and regression analysis reveal that there was a strong and positive relationship between information architecture and customer loyalty. Also, organization, navigation, labeling and search systems were positively correlated with customer loyalty. The results could be a reference for designing of the E-Commerce website.

%X Doing what others do, herding behaviour has been shown to exist in various situations. Facing the information asymmetry problems in online shopping, customers are likely to purchase what others have purchased, which would make good retailers even better. However, because of the differences in customer preference and the intrinsic needs to be different from others, customers may not follow other’s decisions. With a panel data set collected from taobao.com, this study empirically examines whether herding effect exists in retailing market and how herding effect varies across product categories if it exists. This study extends the understanding of herding to an e-commerce context. By empirically showing that retailers that have a higher historical sale sell more in the future and this effect differs with different product categories, this study has important managerial implications for both online retailers and e-commerce platforms.

%X More retailers are now incorporating the Internet as a channel to their existing operations and becoming multichannel retailers. However, not all multichannel retailers are successful in their attempts and even some otherwise successful traditional retailers have failed to capitalize on the Internet as a retail channel. This paper explores the various multichannel strategies of some American prominent retailers in an attempt to identify key success factors in the incorporation of the Internet as a distribution channel. This exploratory analysis concludes with some managerial implications on the use of the Internet as an element of a retailers’ multichannel strategy.

%X The influence of recommendation agents on e-commerce ecosystem is profound. Technological impact of predictive intelligence could be explained more reasonably by taking a collective perspective. However, the ecosystem perspective has only served as a prologue for discussion regarding technological influence. The lack of research development associated with the technological influence on business in the ecological lens has constrained our understanding of the penetration and the role of technology in business ecosystem evolution. This paper therefore focuses on the impact of recommendation agents for online shopping environment on e-commerce ecosystem. Moreover, this paper observes and explains the phenomena that most participants in the e-commerce ecosystem are taking recommendation agents as one of the strategic technological investments towards further development as a common goal.

%X This paper proposes a model of the mediating role of initial trust on the relationship between website quality and customers’ purchase intention in the context of business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce. The model predicts that website quality (measured as functionality and appearance) affects initial trust (measured as competence trust and goodwill trust) which subsequently affects purchase intention. An empirical test was conducted to examine the model. The functionality construct failed to meet the validity test and, as a result, was dropped from the empirical model. The remaining constructs showed acceptable levels of validity and reliability. The structural model revealed that goodwill trust had a negative effect on purchase intention, and thus an alternative model is proposed in which competence trust is a mediating variable between website quality and purchase intention. The alternative model fits the data better than the original model, and the implications are discussed.

%X Though many previous studies has proved the importance of trust from various perspectives, the researches about online consumer’s trust are fragmented in nature and still it need more attention from academics. Lack of consumers trust in online systems is a critical impediment to the success of e-Commerce. Therefore it is important to explore the critical factors that affect the formation of user’s trust in online environments. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of various antecedents of online trust and to predict the user’s intention to engage in online transaction based on their trust in the Information systems. This study is conducted among Asian online consumers and later the results were compared with those from Non-Asian regions. Another objective of this paper is to integrate De Lone and McLean model of IS Success and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for measuring the significance of online trust in e-Commerce adoption. The results of this study show that perceived security, perceived privacy, vendor familiarity, system quality and service quality are the significant antecedents of online trust in a B2C e-Commerce context.

%X In the increasingly competitive Internet business landscape, content is more and more employed for marketing purposes. While online retailers are raising investments in content to promote their online shops, media companies are starting to monetize their content by building own e-commerce platforms. The rationale behind these content-driven commerce approaches is to create a satisfying online shopping experience and, thus, to foster customer loyalty. However, whether content is a suitable means to these ends has not yet been proven. One obstacle is that there is no measurement instrument that captures all relevant characteristics of content on a website. We seek to fill this gap by developing a unified content quality scale in the context of B2C e-commerce. In this paper, we report on the first two of five steps in the scale development process and provide an initial proposal for a formativeformative second-order content quality construct. In contrast to previous measures, our scale considers hedonic characteristics of content and thus contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the concept. Furthermore, both media companies and online retailers can benefit from this scale by applying it to evaluate the effects of their content-driven commerce approaches on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

%X On the one hand, the increasing digitalization of commerce has put local owner operated retail outlets (LOOROs) under pressure to adapt their business models to the new technological and competitive environment as well as to the changing shopping habits of their customers. On the other hand, it also offers potential competitive advantages for them. This paper investigates the retailers’ perception of the competition and their perception of customer expectations, combined with a survey of the current use of digitalized services and the LOOROs readiness to increase the usage of digitalized services. Our results confirm that the perception of competitive pressure and customer expectations has a positive influence on LOOROs’ readiness to adopt new technologies and business models. But a significant number of the surveyed retailers underestimate the expectations of their customers and are reluctant to add digital services to their business portfolio. While our key findings are relevant insights for all LOOROs on their journey towards digitalization, our findings provide even more significant insights for all digital service providers aiming to take a slice of the still substantial market shares of LOOROs in rural areas.

%X Service digitization increasingly impacts work and life. A frequent example is Internet banking. While customers act independently from time and space constraints, banks benefit from significantly lower transaction costs compared to branches. However, customers use online channels for distinct transactions and favor physical interactions with bank advisors for others. To understand the underlying drivers for the intention to use digital banking services, we derive a research model that is theoretically grounded in the Information Processing View. It is validated in a quantitative study with 338 evaluations among retail banking customers. The results indicate that customers’ information requirements and process risk negatively impact intended digital process use. In contrast, process experience positively impacts the intended digital process use. This paper is, to our best knowledge, the first to explore the role of information requirements and process-specific characteristics in detail. It guides practitioners in establishing more effective and efficient digital banking services.

%X While the use of smartphones is increasing, conversion rates for mobile platforms are still significantly lower than those for traditional e-commerce channels, suggesting that these platforms are characterized by distinct consumption patterns. In this research, using detailed event log-files of an online jewelry retailer, we analyze user engagement and navigation behaviors on both platforms, model search goals and their effect on purchase decisions, and develop a conversion prediction model. Our initial results show that user engagement is significantly higher in PC sessions compared to mobile sessions, although mobile sessions reflect a higher level of user engagement than PC sessions. These results indicate that m-commerce involves more than ensuring mobile-compatibility of websites, and that mobile consumers follow a distinct path to purchase involving distinct search and browsing behaviors. Therefore, analysis of the different types of consumption behaviors is necessary to understand the factors that lead to conversion on mobile e-commerce platforms.

%X Increasingly, researchers have come to acknowledge  that consumption activities comprise both utilitarian and hedonic elements. Whereas utilitarian consumption accentuates the achievement of predetermined outcomes typical of cognitive customer behavior, its hedonic counterpart relates to affective customer behavior in dealing with the emotive and multi-sensory aspects of the consumption experience. While utilitarian consumption activities appeal to the rationality of customers in inducing their intellectual buy-in of the consumption experience, customers’ emotional buy-in can only be attained through hedonic consumption activities. The same can be said for online shopping. Because the online shopping environment is characterized bythe existence of an IT-enabled web interface that acts as the focal point of contact between customers and vendors, its design should embed utilitarian and hedonic elements in order to create a holistic  consumption experience. Drawing on the Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), this study advances a model that not only delineates between utilitarian and hedonic customer expectations for online shopping but also highlights how these expectations can be best served through design elements of e-commerce websites catering to functional and aesthetic performance respectively. The model is then empirically verified via an online survey administered on a sample of 303 student respondents. Theoretical contributions and pragmatic implications to be gleaned from our empirical findings are discussed.

%X The rapid adoption of e-Commerce, especially Business-to-Business (B2B) e-Commerce among Ready-made Garments (RMG) industry is a key opportunity for local and international trade development of developing countries like Bangladesh. However, although high expectations for realizing the benefits of B2B e-Commerce in RMG sectors, its adoption remains poorly understood and are a relatively under-researched area in Bangladesh. This study is an attempt to fill this gap. This study explores the factors that affect B2B e-Commerce adoption in RMG sectors of Bangladesh by using Perceived eReadiness Model (PERM). A questionnaire survey was used to collect data from over 250 RMG firms in Bangladesh. The data was analyzed by using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method; a statistical analysis technique based on the Structural Equation Model. The study found that awareness, resources, government eReadiness, and market forces eReadiness were significant factors for initial adoption of B2B e-Commerce. However, commitment, governance, and supporting industries eReadiness are insignificant for initial adoption of B2B e-Commerce. Again, the relationships between resources, commitment, government eReadiness, market forces eReadiness, supporting industries eReadiness and institutionalization of B2B e-Commerce are significant in RMG sectors of Bangladesh. However, awareness, governance and institutionalization of B2B e-Commerce are insignificant. The output of the study can help RMG firms in Bangladesh to address the factors that influence adoption of B2B e-Commerce. This study can also help the policy maker and government to identify the promising local opportunities for B2B e-Commerce by discovering the distinctive e-Commerce adoption factors.

As the popularity of online shopping is constantly growing, the author performed an integrative literature review of 66 journal articles on e-emotions (consumer emotions visible in an online environment) and classified the articles into four groups. According to the analysis of the groups, consumer emotions are present at various points of the e-commerce relationship from pre-purchase intentions to post- consumption behavior. Based on this literature review, directions for future research in e-emotions are also introduced.

%X Costly product returns have become a significant problem for most online retailers. In this study, we investigate the conflicting relationship between online product page viewing and product returns. Based on expectation disconfirmation theory, we explain two counteracting effects of product page viewing on product returns, and propose that more product page viewing leads to higher likelihood of product returns. Moreover, we examine the role of three IT systems, namely product recommendation systems, product visualization systems and consumer review systems, in attenuating the effect of product page viewing on product returns. By using a unique clickstream dataset, we employ a fixed effect logit model to test the research hypotheses. Our study has the potential to contribute to the extant literature by unveiling how consumers’ pre-purchase behaviors influence their return behaviors. Practitioners can also benefit from this research in deciding how to economically invest in IT systems to reduce product return rates.

%X Shipping is one of the costliest elements of online retail; it is also a sore topic for consumers. There is still relatively little or no research that examines the relative role of shipping and return-shipping costs on consumers’ purchasing intentions. In this research, we examine two questions: what is the relative role of shipping and return-shipping costs on consumers’ purchase intentions. Secondly, how does gender moderate the relationships between the above costs and subsequent purchasing intentions? Data was collected using Amazon Mechanical Turk from respondents all over the US. The findings show that shipping costs impact purchasing decisions for both expensive and inexpensive products. However, return-shipping affects the purchasing intentions for costly products only, more so for males than for females. In all, the study makes a unique contribution by examining the shipping and return-shipping cost questions in online buying that are relatively understudied so far.

%X The number of product returns represents a considerable cost factor in e-commerce, especially in the apparel sector. The application of advanced information technologies and predictive analytics, enabling to capture and analyze massive amounts of user data, pave the way for a more efficient management of product returns and reverse logistics. However, we identify a lack of data-driven approaches in this area, especially regarding product returns prediction. In this paper, we present an ensemble selection approach for predicting product returns in the apparel sector. Computational experiments indicate that our approach produces satisfying results in terms of prediction quality. We further explore the correlation between sample sizes and computational times. Thereby, we demonstrate that the run-time increases exponentially when using more data records. To address heavy run-time overheads resulting from high processing and memory requirements of classifiers, we present a framework to embed ensemble selection processes into a highly scalable cloud environment. The framework explains the provisioning of cloud resources and parallelization of tasks according to ensemble selection processes. It further builds a basis for considering data streams, data splitting, and a dynamic adoption of changing customer behavior over time, which has not been considered in related work so far. The envisioned forecasting support system aids retailers in reducing product returns and increasing profit margins.

%X The study proposes a framework based on functional analysis of transaction data to predict customer spending during promotional events. Retailers face the challenge of considering an extant number of variables and of accounting for methodological constraints while modeling customer response to promotions. Noise and uneven distribution of spending further introduces error into traditional models’ estimates. We represent each customer’s spending as a continuous curve that accounts for heterogeneity due to the purchase cycle as well as cross sectional differences. In order to obtain an optimal functional representation we utilize a data driven iterative procedure. Statistical information from the collection of spending curves is drawn using functional data analysis (FDA). Analysis of a real customer dataset from a North American retail chain shows that the dynamics of information captured by optimal functional representation of transaction data significantly improves predictions for out of sample observations.

%X There has been widespread use of auto-ID technologies. With the increasing diffusion of smartphones, the potential to serve content to shoppers using auto-ID technologies is starting to receive interest. Using a design science approach, we design and build, theorize about, and compare six shopping assistance artifacts by manipulating the hardware design—barcode scanner versus radio frequency identification (RFID) reader—and content design—product information versus product review versus both. We theorize about how these artifact conditions will compare to a control condition (no shopping assistance artifact available) across three sets of outcomes: technology adoption, security beliefs, and shopping. We tested our propositions in two experiments—wherein the task was varied: general browsing and shopping (n = 227) versus goal-directed shopping (n = 221)—conducted in a retail store laboratory. The RFID reader was most favorably received in terms of technology adoption outcomes and shopping outcomes, although it was most negatively viewed in terms of security beliefs. We also found that the content design conditions (i.e., product information, product reviews, and both) were perceived favorably. In a post hoc analysis, we found a two-way interaction of hardware and content designs such that content fueled by RFID was perceived most favorably in terms of technology adoption and shopping outcomes, whereas it was most negatively viewed in terms of security beliefs. Interestingly, the two-way interaction was most pronounced in the goal-directed shopping condition such that the most positive effects were observed for RFID in combination with both product information and reviews.

%X The experiential and body-involving nature of apparel makes consumers’ product evaluation in the virtual shopping environment a lasting problem. With the newly emerging online pictorial reviews, consumers are more informed about the product. However, how pictorial reviews would influence consumers’ psychological evaluation process and their purchase intention remains unclear. Drawing on the Self-Congruity Theory, we hypothesized that the attractiveness of peer consumer within a pictorial review will positively affect consumers’ perceived peer-self image congruity (i.e., a positive “beauty” effect), and this effect will be moderated by the orientation of textual reviews (i.e., valueexpressive oriented vs. utilitarian oriented) alongside. Moreover, consumers’ perceived peer-self image congruity will positively influence consumers’ purchase intention, and this effect will be moderated by consumers’ public self-consciousness. The results of a lab experiment supported most of the hypotheses. This study contributes to the emerging literature of pictorial review by highlighting the importance of peer-self image congruity in determining consumers’ purchase intention. It also contributes to the general literature of customer review by unraveling the contingent effect of pictorial reviews depending on textual reviews. These results provide important managerial implications for online retailers.

%X Asia continues to lead e-commerce growth worldwide, with multi-sided platforms like Alibaba.com, 360buy.com and Taobao.com leading the race. Despite their rising prominence, few studies articulate how these multi-sided platforms in Asia service and collaborate with it sides. It is important to learn how platforms encounter and adapt to changing suppliers-platform-customers interactions, to better understand the implications of e-commerce necessary to compete and lead in this digitally enabled landscape. Furthermore, scholars suggest research to discern between modernization of Asia and Westernization. To close these gaps, the authors conduct a case study of two of China’s leading multi-sided digital platforms—A.com and M.com. The researchers cross-examine the development of the two firms since their establishing, focusing on collaborative strategies with their sides and within their business units, through interdependencies and collective action conceptual perspectives. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a framework that identifies four types (I-IV) of multi-sided platform collaborations. This framework prescribes guidelines to identify and manage different types of collaborative action for strategic planning and operations between platform partners. Secondly, we consolidate four lessons learnt from our data—teach, consolidate, co-opete and ultimately lead—a set of actionable guidelines for platform leadership in the marketplace.

%X “Second-order digital inequality" describes that certain individuals profit less from digital opportunities not only due to limited access but also due to limited abilities to use information and communication technologies (ICT). This study extends research on second-order digital inequality to the realm of e-commerce. We introduce a novel conceptualization of effective, potentially beneficial, e-commerce use that encompasses two dimensions: (1) the diversity of e-commerce platforms used by an individual; (2) the degree to which an individual uses supporting e-commerce features. Building on technology acceptance theory and social psychology, we argue that socio-economically disadvantaged individuals are less likely to use e-commerce effectively than socio-economically advantaged individuals. We empirically test our hypotheses on clickstream data that tracks the online behavior of 2819 US e-commerce users for six month. Our findings reveal that, despite equal access, the socio-economically advantaged use e-commerce more effectively regarding both dimensions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

%X Consumer finance has penetrated into people’s daily life, especially in the field of e-commerce online shopping. In order to stimulate consumers’ desire to buy, adjusting credit line has become the marketing strategy of many merchants. However, little research has been done on whether this method can really cause consumers to buy impulsively. This paper discusses the relationship between the credit line adjustment of e-commerce consumer finance and the impulse purchasing desire of consumers in the context of online sales promotion in the “double eleven shopping festival”. In this research, data is collected by adopting simulated methods, and the data is analyzed through the SPSS. The research result shows that the increase of the consumption finance credit line positively affects the consumer impulse purchasing desire, and positive emotion has mediating effect; the results of this research can help e-commerce platforms to manage the credit line reasonably and formulate effective marketing strategies to enhance its competitiveness in the online market.

%X Reputation stems from overall assessments of an e-business’s standing, according to various stakeholders, and it affects key customer outcomes. Despite burgeoning literature on the correlates of the customer-based reputation of e-commerce companies (ECCR), scarce research examines how reputation affects monetary outcomes. To extend existing literature on ECCR outcomes, this study focuses on customer equity. Surveys of customers from various online shopping contexts reveal, across two studies, the relationship between ECCR and customer equity. The authors also investigate contingencies of this relationship, positing that trust has a mediating role and perceived risk takes a moderating role. This study thereby adds a richer understanding of the customer-related effects of corporate reputation and yields important managerial insights into the mechanisms through which an e-business’s reputation affects customer equity.

%X Easy access to digital analysis of customer behavior and targeted advertising are principal advantages online retailers have over their stationary counterparts. \ Existing manual and digital means for monitoring customer behavior in high streets are expensive to employ and/or technically complex, making them unfeasible for many retailers.  \  \ This paper shows an approach for individual stores and high streets as a whole to facilitate spatio-temporal customer data collection based on connected mobile devices, Bluetooth beacons, and an underlying  multi-sided community platform. A framework of analytical perspectives on customer data regarding various levels of analysis and beneficiaries is conceived, which provides novel design knowledge on location-based smart services for customer behavior analysis and targeted advertising in high streets.

%X This paper proposes a revision of the multichannel concept as it has been applied in previous studies on multichannel commerce. Digitalization and technological innovations have blurred the line between physical and electronic channels. A structured literature review on multichannel consumer and firm behaviour is conducted to reveal the established view on multichannel phenomena. By providing empirical evidence on market offerings and consumer perceptions, we expose a significant mismatch between the dominant conceptualization of multichannel commerce applied in research and today’s market realities. This tension highlights the necessity for a changed view on multichannel commerce to study and understand phenomena in converging sales channels. Therefore, an extended conceptualization of multichannel commerce, named the multichannel continuum, is proposed. \  \ This is the first study that considers the broad complexity of integrated multichannel decisions. It aims at contributing to the literature on information systems and channel choice by developing a reference frame for studies on how technological advancements that allow the integration of different channels shape consumer and firm decision making in multichannel commerce. Accordingly, a brief research agenda contrasts established findings with unanswered questions, challenges and opportunities that arise in this more complex multichannel market environment. \

%X This study investigates the impact of incongruence between visual and text-based information about a product provided by sellers on e-commerce websites. We hypothesize that the incongruence between the quantity presented in a visual representation and a text-based description will produce a negative effect on the product evaluation of customers. Two pilot studies provide initial evidence to support this hypothesis. This result suggests that the effect needs to be further investigated with higher level of sophistication both in terms of theory and empirical support. While it is generally encouraged to maintain design-level consistency in multi-modal communication setting, e-commerce researchers and practitioners have not perfected the mechanisms to respond to message-level incongruence issue. By adopting dual process theories of thinking, when completed, this study will provide a detailed theoretical account of how incongruence between visual representation and linguistic descriptions would affect customers’ evaluation of a product selling online.

%X The retailing industry traditionally considers the optimal products selection and pricing problem, a complex and challenging one, from marketing and consumer behavior's perspectives. In this study, we take a risk perspective and offer an alternative solution to tackling the problem, echoing the most recent literature that looks at non-risk aspects, such as expected consumer preference, market size and predicted profitability. Adopting a mean-variance framework, our approach explicitly takes into account the interconnectedness of retail products and their impact on risk at the portfolio (retailer) level. Extending the analysis to multiple-channel decisions, our results suggest that the introduction of a new retailing channel (e.g. online shops) can reduce the portfolio risk, whereas a lack of synergy between the new channel and the existing ones may lead to a negative impact on the overall performance. We also provide managerial implications on several conditions when retailers are more economically inclined to introduce more retail channels. Interestingly, our model indicates that larger retailers are less likely to expand their online platform.

%X With the increase in Internet-based sales, attracting and retaining online customers has become the most important part of running a successful business. In order to maintain customer loyalty, website designers should consider providing gender sensitized user experience as men and women have been known to have different perceptions of online shopping.  Women tend to prefer shopping experience that creates connection with other humans. Online shopping experience, in general, can be perceived as lacking human warmth and sociability as it is devoid of interactions with other humans. However, to date, influence of social presence (interpreting human warmth and contact electronically) on e-Loyalty across genders has been relatively underexplored. In this research-in-progress paper, we present a research model to study the effects of gender differences on social presence cues in retail websites.  As a part of future work, we plan to use survey methodology to analyze and validate the research model.

%X Identifying customers’ preferences is a challenging task with significant practical implications for online shopping. Current methods often put considerable burden on the customers through such methods as questioning, so the process could benefit from a more accurate and less intrusive estimation of how customers weight product attributes, particularly in the initial purchasing phase. Our goal is to derive attribute weights automatically by recording and analyzing cursor movements. We conducted an experiment to confirm the suitability of the proposed design, and found a highly significant correlation between the time people spend investigating a product attribute and their self-reported importance rating. Our proposed Web page design might also reduce the risk of information overload.

%X Social Commerce is a growing upshot of electronic commerce in Nigeria. It is influencing the existing value networks and turning around the global economy. Many authors have impacted the body of knowledge in the context of mobile commerce and social media as a separate research domain, but the fusion of mobile commerce and social media still need more scholars’ attention most especially in the developing nations. This study applies the hybrid technique to sort out social commerce customers’ reviews, appraise the quality of the extracted data and identify the opinion that transpired between online retailing merchants and online customers. The appraisal theory used for the pairing of mobile commerce and social media explain how attitude and graduation connect engagement in mobile commerce products and services review. The equilibrium of mobile commerce and Facebook stands to improve customer service. This study offers some managerial implications to the social commerce and electronic marketing practitioners.

%X Achieving a better rank online is often costly. Is the effect of ranking different for mobile devices and traditional PC? This study empirically examines the ranking effect across different device types in an e-commerce environment. With over 4 million observations from Tweaker.net, the largest shopbot in Netherlands, we estimated the ranking effect between mobile and PC. Surprisingly, and contrary to prior findings, our results across different model specifications consistently show that ranking effect is smaller on mobile devices. This study extends the understanding about the effect of position in e-commerce context by empirically examining the ranking effect across devices. This study has important managerial implications for retailers and e-commerce platforms. As the ranking effect is smaller on mobile devices, retailers should take account of the source of traffic (mobile or PC) while bidding for a particular position. And platforms should consider the different ranking effects on different channels.

%X Despite the prevalence of online shopping, consumers’ hedonic experience, when shopping online, is often limited due to static product images and uninspiring product description in textual form. To this end, this study endeavors to shed light on how contemporary and widely applied online product presentation formats influence consumers’ hedonic web shopping experience. Building on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we advance a theoretical model that posits enjoyment and flow as positive indicators of consumers’ hedonic web shopping experience, which in turn affects their behavioral intents to return and purchase from an e-commerce website. Our theoretical model is then subjected to empirical validation through an experiment that distinguishes between functional (product description) and visual (product display) dimensions of online product presentation. Findings suggest that hedonic web shopping could be induced through online product presentation that exhibits interactivity, vividness and social presence.

In this paper, we consider the connected home application domain of the IoT from an online retail perspective and explore factors that may affect a consumerâ€™s behavioral intention to adopt IoT enabled online shopping (IoTOS) artifacts such as Amazonâ€™s Dash Wand and the Google Home smart speaker.  Based on the existing body of knowledge in the Information Systems (IS) field, we identify key factors including security concerns (composed of data confidentiality concerns and information privacy concerns), performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and price value, as determinants of an individualâ€™s behavioral intention to use IoTOS artifacts.  In doing so, we provide both a foundation for future research pertaining to consumer adoption of connected home innovations as well as offer insights that may help shape such innovations and their associated services.

%X In the context of e-commerce, personalization system provides customers with recommendations on what products to buy. Grounded on social exchange theory, this study empirically examines and theoretically articulates the effects of willingness to share information and adaptive personalization on willingness to repurchase products. A survey was conducted and PLS was used demonstrating that adaptive personalization fully mediates the relationship between willingness to share information and willingness to repurchase products. The results suggest that online customers might take risks to provide their information to online retailers in exchange of offerings, and that continuous capturing of customer’s preferences throughout their interaction time with the system can lead to better recommendations from the system, thus providing more incentives for them to repurchase products.

%X An electronic commerce marketing channel is fully mediated by information technology, creating information asymmetry (i.e., limited information). Such asymmetry may impede consumers’ ability to effectively assess certain types of products, thus creating challenges for online sellers. Signaling theory can aid in the understanding of how extrinsic cues—signals—can be used by sellers to convey product quality information to consumers, reducing uncertainty and facilitating a purchase or exchange. This study proposes a model to investigate website quality as a potential signal of product quality and consider the moderating effects of product information asymmetries and signal credibility. The study also finds that perceived value and cognitive lock-in can predict consumer purchase intentions. Furthermore, personalized product recommendation (PPR) services offered by online retailers are found to influence consumer store loyalty. The results indicate that website quality influences consumers’ perceptions of product quality, and affects online purchase intentions. Website quality is found to have a greater influence on perceived product quality when consumers have higher information asymmetry. Signal credibility is found to strengthen the relationship between website quality and product quality perceptions for a high quality website. The implications of cognitive lock-in and product cues for increasing purchase intentions are discussed. Retailer learning reflected in higher quality PPRs is associated with both lower product screening cost and higher product evaluation cost. We also discuss which PPRs influence consumer repurchase intentions in electronic markets.

%X A typical shopping scenario nowadays is that shoppers browse and try the products offline and then buy them online from a competing retailer. This phenomenon commonly described as “showrooming” occurs because of the ubiquity of mobile devices and the ease of switching between multiple retail channels. The presence of these mobile-assisted shoppers in a multichannel retailing environment is a serious challenge confronting all retailers. This study first identifies these cross-channel shoppers’ reasons for and against showrooming and then uses the behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) to predict their showrooming intention. Next, we identify two factors, namely online-offline price difference and employee knowledge competency that can further impact showrooming intention and subsequently develop a 3x2 scenario-based experiment to examine the effectiveness of these two measures to influence showrooming. We provide theoretical and managerial implications arising from our research.

%X Most previous research studied the effect of e-service and website quality on customer (re)purchase intention. Multiple studies found that customers’ espoused cultural values influenced their perception of e-service and website quality. However, the role of such differences on customers (re)purchase intention with respect to website quality has not been studied until now. In this study, we examined the moderating role of customer’s espoused cultural values on the effect of website quality and ultimately on repurchase intention using Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and Loiacono’s WebQual. Our empirical findings suggest that ignoring the espoused cultural differences of customers when examining the effect of website quality on (re)purchase intention leads to misleading results. Thus, this study extends previous research by adding an important construct to the previous general model (the direct effect of website quality on repurchase intention) and makes it easier to better understand online consumers’ repurchase intention.

%X With more internet giants develop online shopping platform, the credit of platform has become the key point of competitive advantages. The sellers are the supplier of credit, while the platform is the supervisor of credit. Game model is built to study the factors affect the seller’s credit supply and the platform’s supervision intensity. We draw suggestions about how to optimize the credit supply, which include proper intensity of supervision, differentiated supervision strategy, improvements of credit evaluation mechanism and supervision of social organizations. Furthermore, the supervision from authentic social organization works more efficiently to the platform with high profits.

%X Product return is a major issue for e-marketplace sellers because it restricts profit growth. E-commerce customers return about one third of all transactions each year, representing about ten percent of revenue. In China, a new regulation requiring online sellers to provide a money-back guarantee within seven days without reason has intensified the need to reduce the rate of returns. Drawing on the stimulus-organism-response framework, we investigate how sellers can use various platform-based technologies (e.g. pricing-, marketing-, product presentation-, and customer service-oriented technologies) along the online exchange process to increase customer satisfaction and reduce the rate of returns. The hypotheses will be tested using a unique longitudinal dataset of 40,000 seller-month observations from China’s biggest e-marketplace, Taobao.

%X In this study, we use a proprietary data set from an online marketplace to study the conversion rate dynamics in online retail. We examine how seller-level covariates, such as online sellers’ pricing and product strategies, service responsiveness, and other attributes, affect conversion rates. Specifically, we address the following research questions: (i) How do sellers’ covariates affect their conversion rates? (ii) Is the relationship between the conversion rate and sellers’ covariates state dependent? (iii) If the relationship is state dependent, what are the factors that determine the states and the state transitions? The estimation results indicate that there are two states that affect conversion rate dynamics. The relationship between the conversion rate and the sellers’ covariates is state dependent, that is, given the different states of sellers, the effects of the sellers’ covariates on their conversion rates are different. We also estimate the thresholds between states.

%X Price comparison sites (shopbots) are supposed to create price transparent markets. Nevertheless, online prices are still very dispersed, making the question when and how customers are influenced by price transparency the key for understanding electronic channels. This study is the first empirical investigation of this question using transaction data from the largest online retailer Amazon and a large price comparison site. Based on a unique dataset of 29,667 price and sales figures for 291 products in three product categories, the impact of competitors’ prices on sales is analyzed. We find support for our hypothesis that price comparison is generally more important for the low price products within a product group and less important for the average priced product. Results vary for the highest priced products. The results are translated into practical guidelines for firms trying to optimize their competitive pricing strategy.

%X Ecommerce models offer many benefits for business operations, such as convenience and easiness, decreased cost of inventory management, expanded customer base, enabled globalization and business analytics, etc. Virtual business models also promote sustainability by reducing energy and resource usage. Despite its pronounced benefits, ecommerce is still subject to challenges of environmental sustainability especially in rural areas. This research-in-progress study intends to better understand environmental implications of ecommerce in rural areas with the exploration of three questions: 1) how are sellers and buyers conscious about ecommerce sustainability in rural areas, 2) What eco-innovation practices are engaged by business, and 3) what are environmental consequences associated with various types of deliver innovations.

%X The topic of shopping attitude has received long lasing attention in the context of e-commerce. Previous studies have elucidated the different facets of online shopping attitude and have overemphasized a prevalent assertion on the relationship between web design artifacts and consumers’ psychological responses. However, the imitability of web design in practice makes no differentiation among a glut of shopping websites and probably leads to revenue declination due to the fact that the instability of attitude frequently leads to attitudinal ambivalence. Hence, understanding how to strengthen consumers’ attitudes toward online shopping should be fruitful for remedying attitude inconsistency in e-commerce. The current study extended related research by examining the simultaneous effects of trusting beliefs on consumers’ attitudes toward online shopping. We adopted the concept of structural assurance and the principles of persuasion as the theoretical underpinnings. The proposed model is expected to contribute to relevant literature by offering theoretical contributions and managerial implications that can help both researchers and online retailers to understand more clearly how consumers develop their attitudes toward shopping online.

%X Returns management – an important component of supply chain management – is a key aspect of online retailers’ business models. Despite increasing interest in this issue, few studies have published empirical results on the drivers of consumer returns in e-tailing. Because this knowledge is essential to enabling better decisions about return flows, we explored an extensive dataset from an online apparel retailer using linear and logistic regression models. This approach distinguishes our study from other empirical work, which is usually based on survey methods. Before the data analysis, previously untested hypotheses were formulated using established theories and anecdotal information.

%X Online retailers provide review systems to consumers in order to improve perceived trustworthiness and boost sales. We examine the effects of review valence and valence intensity on consumer purchase intention. Review adoption emerges as a novel, important moderating variable. We find that positive reviews have a stronger effect on consumer purchase intention than negative reviews. Moderate reviews always lead to higher purchase intention than extreme reviews, but the size of the effect is greater for extremely negative reviews than moderately negative reviews. The effect is reversed for positive reviews. Our results imply that a recent innovation in Amazon’s review system, highlighting negative reviews along with positive spotlight reviews, must be designed carefully to avoid losing customers. Choosing the wrong combination of reviews can diminish the positive effect of spotlight reviews on sales by nearly 20%.

%X The proliferation of social media platforms, especially the social networking sites (SNSs), has been changing customers’ online purchasing habits during the last decades. Recently, online marketers not only release advertising on e-commerce platforms but also promote their products and services on social media platforms. In this study we focus on e-commerce adverting in SNSs. We believe that customers are willing to adopt the advertising information published on SNSs for their purchase related decisions making because they trust those platforms and the advertising posted on them. With this research, we seek to explore the relation between customers’ trust in SNSs, customers’ trust in advertising information posted on the sites and customers’ intentions of adopting advertising information to make purchase related decisions. We believe that if an individual trusts the social networking site he/she uses, he/she will trust the advertising information published on it and have intentions to adopt the information to make purchase related decisions. An online survey with 134 subjects shows that trust can be transferred from SNSs to the advertising information posted on the platforms and subjects have intentions to adopt that information to make purchase related decisions. The study also discusses the implications for social commerce, focusing on commercial activities mediated by social media.

%X Cross-border e-commerce has been rapidly expanding. However, little research has been done to investigate how consumers decide to shop across national borders. This study aims to explore the factors that impact consumers’ intention to shop on foreign websites. A conceptual model is developed from the perspectives of consumer perceived trust and value. We also examine the effects of vendors’ signaling on perceived trust, as well as the effects of benefits and costs on perceived value. This study conducts an online survey to test the research model. Our findings can help researchers and practitioners understand the barriers to cross-border e-commerce and devise strategies to overcome these barriers.

%X The transformation of the smartphone into a key integrating factor of the online & offline retailing environment has lead to the development of mobile applications that shape the omniretailing landscape. The present study provides evidence of the mobile retailing apps frequency of use inside physical stores and explores mobile retailing app assisted shoppers’ preferences of in-store omniretailing practices & technologies. Results reveal that price comparison that could lead to showrooming is of utmost important for consumers. In parallel, consumers that attach great importance to such practice significantly differ from the rest, in terms of the importance they attach to salespeople & omnichannel integration criteria, in order to purchase offline. In contrast, there weren’t found statistically significant differences in terms of the importance they attach to online & offline store atmosphere. Nevertheless, the importance attached to online store atmosphere is high among mobile retailing app assisted shoppers. Drawing on these results, the study provides feedback to retail entrepreneurs regarding the optimal design and features of the future physical retail store.

%X Recent changes in web technologies have given a voice to consumers in online discussion of products and services. While the web has long been a source of information about products and services, web content was controlled by those who knew how to develop for the web, or those who could hire web developers. The trend toward web software that permits novice users to contribute to conversations about products has been embraced by online retailers, who facilitate and encourage online user reviews of products. Researchers are just starting to understand the relationship between online user reviews and purchase intention, however have determined that trust is central to the development of purchase intention. In this study, we report the results of a simulation based web purchase experiment that included subjects in Colombia, the People’s Republic of China and the United States. The experiment included manipulations for both information quality and a social component of the review, and espoused culture scores of subjects where measured. We find that information quality, the social component and espoused uncertainty avoidance influence trust in the review. We were not able to support an interaction effect between information quality and uncertainty avoidance and trust, nor an interaction effect between the social component and collectivism.

%X We define an economic network as a linked set of products, where links are created by realizations of shared outcomes between entities. We analyze the predictive information contained in an increasingly prevalent type of economic network, a “product network” that links the landing pages of goods frequently co-purchased on e-commerce websites. Our data include one million books in 400 categories spanning two years, with over 70 million observations. Using autoregressive and neural-network models, we demonstrate that combining historical demand of a product with that of its neighbors improves demand predictions even as the network changes over time. Furthermore, network properties such as clustering and centrality contribute significantly to predictive accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study showing that a non-static product network contains useful distributed information for demand prediction, and that this information is more effectively exploited by integrating composite structural network properties into one’s predictive models.

%X As digitalization and technological innovations have blurred the line between physical and electronic channels, enormous growth rates in internet use have motivated most established retailers to expand their business to include online sales. These multichannel retailers are now under severe pressure from pure online retailers, since their physical infrastructure decreases their ability to compete via prices. While this infrastructure could also present opportunities to differentiate themselves by offering integrated multichannel services, their appeal is not fully understood by either researchers or practitioners.  Building upon previous studies in online and offline commerce, this study investigates and explains the impact of different multichannel integration services on consumers’ channel selection preferences. The results indicate that the appeal of integrated multichannel offerings differs widely from the previously investigated channel options. Accordingly, channel convergence requires research to adapt to technological advancements and apply a more complex view to the study of multichannel commerce.

%X Many multichannel retailers are now offering customers the option to place their orders online and then pick them up from the retailers’ physical stores. As a relatively new type of multichannel retail service, the factors that influence consumers to use “online order/in-store pickup” (OOIP) remains largely unknown. This study uses the Behavioral Reasoning Theory to examine the factors that influence individuals’ attitude and intention toward using OOIP service. A survey was conducted with 212 Chinese consumers. Findings suggest that informational social influence, normative social influence, and attitude toward using OOIP service have direct impact on individuals’ intention to use OOIP service. Furthermore, even though reasons for using OOIP service could determine individuals’ attitude, they do not influence individuals’ intention directly. Conversely, while reasons against using OOIP service do not affect individuals’ attitude, they can impact individuals’ intention directly. We provide theoretical and managerial implications arising from our findings.

%X Online Customer Reviews (OCRs) have become a powerful marketing tool for e-commerce companies and an important information source for customers in online shopping. We study the influence of OCRs on sales and conversion rates of experience goods along different levels of product involvement and brand equity. We make use of a unique dataset with about 2.8 billion product detail page (PDP) views, 85.3 million sold items along 40 product categories and .9 million OCRs from a leading Euro-pean online fashion company. We find that the rating valence (i.e., the average rating), has a positive influence on sales and conversion in general. Further, we identify the positive influence of OCRs on sales and conversion to be stronger for products with a high level of product involvement. Finally, this study shows that brand equity has a negative influence on the relationship between rating valence, sales, and conversion. From a managerial perspective, this study helps to use OCR as a marketing tool in the most efficient and effective way as companies should implement category and brand-specific OCR strategies.

%X Based on a large-scale, unique longitudinal dataset comprising more than 4m transactions, I first investigate drivers of customers’ point of sale choice (online vs. counter PoS). Second, I study which PoS yields higher purchase decision quality. I establish whether linkages hold across different customer segments and pricing contexts, and examine consumers’ learning effects over time. Third, I study customer loyalty in both distribution channels, and explore how loyalty develops across different segments, pricing contexts, and levels of decision quality. Hypotheses are tested in the context of two-part pricing schemes in travel services. Purchase decision quality is in fact dependent on the chosen PoS. Besides, it largely varies across customer segments; however, learning effects do occur over time. Loyalty depends on pricing contexts and segments as well as on previous decision quality and PoS choice. The results provide implications for upgrading consumers’ purchase behavior and acquisition and retention in each channel.

%X Online retailers employ various strategies to encourage consumers to write online product reviews. Monetary incentives---a widely used extrinsic motivation in the business world---are not commonly used by online retailers to encourage consumers to write online product reviews. One plausible explanation is because of the cost of monetary incentives, albeit the trade-off between the cost of monetary incentives versus the benefit of having more online product reviews has not been examined. With a unique panel data set from a major Chinese online retailer that has been offering monetary incentives to encourage consumers to write product reviews, we examine how monetary incentives affect online product reviews and sales. Interestingly, we find that small rewards---less than 1.5 yuan for each product review, can increase product sales significantly. Our findings suggest that paying for product reviews can be an effective strategy for online retailers to increase sales.

%X Website service quality has been considered to be important to increase users’ stickiness toward website in online shopping context. However, the underlying mechanism through which website service quality can influence shopping website stickiness remains unclear. In this study, the concept of website involvement was introduced to explain why people tend to favor sticking a shopping website. Also, four dimensions of website service quality (i.e. recovery , reliability, personalization, and responsiveness) were identified from existing related literature to influence consumers’ website involvement. Unlike prior studies, the “Stimulus-Organism- Response” model and an integrated framework combining the transactional view and the relational view of consumer-website interaction were used to test the relationship among website service quality , website involvement (cognitive involvement and affective involvement), and website stickiness. Empirical result shows that website service quality has no significant direct impact on website stickiness. However, it has significantly positive effects on both cognitive involvement and affective involvement, which in turn significantly correlate to website stickiness, indicating that website involvement plays full mediating role in the relation between website service quality and website stickiness. The results also indicate that consumer affective involvement strongly influences their cognitive involvement toward a shopping website.

%X This study focuses on the antecedents and consequences of Internet buyer regret in the overall purchasing process. We examine the roles that search effort, service-attribute evaluations, product-attribute evaluations and post-purchase price perceptions play in determining buyer regret and satisfaction in e-commerce. Furthermore, the study examines the consequences of regret and satisfaction in regard to purchasing intention. Survey data collected from 422 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) with partial least squares (PLS-Graph 3.0) and support provided for the hypothesized links. These results show that greater search effort and lower evaluations of service, product and price lead to greater buyer regret and dissatisfaction; the consequences of regret include reduced satisfaction and less intention to repurchase. Based on the results, implications for online retailers, as well as suggestions for future research relating to Internet buyer regret, are discussed.

%X Although purchase pressure cues (PPC) that signal limited time (LT) or limited product availability (LPA) are widely used features on e-commerce websites to boost sales, research on whether and why PPCs affect consumers’ purchase choice in online settings has remained largely unexplored. Drawing on the Stimulus-Organism- Response (S-O-R) model, consumer decision-making literature, and prospect theory, we conducted a controlled lab experiment with 121 subjects in the context of Deal-ofthe- Day (DoD) platforms. We demonstrate that while LT pressure cues significantly increase deal choice, LPA pressure cues have no distinct influence on it. Furthermore, our results show that perceived stress and perceived product value serve as two serial mediators explaining the theoretical mechanism of why LT pressure cues affect deal choice. Complementary to these results, we provide evidence that higher perceived stress is accompanied by significant changes in consumers’ physiological arousal. Further theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed.

%X E-Commerce firms collect enormous amounts of information in their databases. Yet, only a fraction is used to improve business processes and decision-making, while many useful sources often remain underexplored. Therefore, we propose a new and interdisciplinary method to identify goals of consumers and develop an online shopping typology. We use k-means clustering and non-parametric analysis of variance tests to categorize search patterns as Buying, Searching, Browsing or Bouncing. Adding to purchase decision-making theory we propose that the use of off-site clickstream data—the sequence of consumers’ advertising channel clicks to a firm’s website—can significantly enhance the understand-ing of shopping motivation and transaction-related behavior, even before entering the website. To run our consumer data analytics we use a unique and extensive dataset from a large European apparel company with over 80 million clicks covering 11 online advertising channels. Our results show that consumers with higher goal-direction have significantly higher purchase propensities, and against our expectations - consumers with higher levels of shopping involvement show higher return rates. Our conceptual approach and insights contribute to theory and practice alike such that it may help to improve real-time decision-making in marketing analytics to substantially enhance the customer experience online.

%X The evolution of technology and the constant digitalisation strongly influence how consumers behave, how markets develop, and how companies and consumers interact. By offering many channels, companies attempt to react to these developments. In recent years, researchers as well as practitioners have proposed omnichannel management as the best approach to offer several channels. An omnichannel strategy enables consumers to use channels seamlessly and interchangeably and experience the channels uniquely. However, reality looks different: many channel management approaches coexist in practice, and in research, terms to describe different concepts are used without clear distinctions. This paper seeks to eliminate ambiguities regarding the term omnichannel management. By delimiting the term from related approaches and understanding current topics discussed by omnichannel management research, this paper creates a common basis from which to fully understand the concept. Omnichannel management has shown relevance in many areas, but particularly in retailing, marketing, and information systems (IS) research. IS plays an important role in the implementation of the omnichannel approach because obstacles are often technology-related and companies are strongly dependent on information technology (IT). To move research on omnichannel management forward, this paper proposes directions for further research.

Based on consumers' browsing and purchase behaviors at the e-commerce site before the addition of mobile commerce channel, we constructed behavioral proxy variables which capture the underlying cost and benefit of mobile commerce channel relative to the pre-existing e-commerce channel. We collected two large datasets from of a large e-marketplace in South Korea that introduced mcommerce to its existing e-commerce offering in 2011. Based on the analysis of browsing and purchase behaviors of 29,283 subjects over a period of 28 months, we find that the need for ubiquity plays a significant role in the m-commerce adoption decision. The two proxies for ubiquity need— Purchase frequency and Purchase time irregularity—were found to have a positive impact on mcommerce adoption. The results also suggest that search cost influences the decision to adopt mcommerce. Specifically, we find that the consumers who search multi-item or categories at a time, engage in active search, and conduct thorough search, are less likely to adopt m-commerce. Finally, the results show that the risk preference of the consumer is related to the adoption decision. Risk aversion, as measured by the two proxies—Reliance on secure log-in system, and Need for receiving confirmations—lowers the likelihood of m-commerce adoption. These results highlight the importance of the unique features of mobile platform in influencing the consumers’ adoption of m-commerce. We discuss the implications of our findings for academics and practitioners.

%X Omnichannel retailing has been getting more and more attention as people’s buying habits become more diverse. BOPS (Buy-on-line, Pick-up-in store) is an important pattern of Omnichannel retailing which has significant impacts on a cross-selling effect and inventory decisions. This paper explores this implementation with cross-selling from a perspective of inventory management by developing and analyzing a mathematical model based on EOQ model. After series of numerical experiments, we found that firms in a perfectly competitive market have motivations to launch BOPS services in most cases, especially when the supply chain structure is centralized. Furthermore, in a decentralized supply chain, if the manufacturer bears the inventory costs generated in B&M stores according to the proportion of BOPS sales when the inventory capacity is not big enough, the retailer can shift a part of costs to the manufacturer by deliberately making biased inventory decisions, and this cost shifting may damage the manufacturer’s motivation to implement BOPS where the cross-selling effect is powerful enough.

%X This research attempts to explore the impacts of different types of justice and their interactions on the satisfaction toward service failure recovery. We attempt to classify justices into hygiene, motivator, or asymmetric variable, based on the concept of asymmetric effect and two factors theory proposed by Herzberg. Specifically, we predict that procedural and distributive justices are hygiene or performance factor and interpersonal justice is motivator. In addition, based on expectancy-disconfirmation theory (EDT), we also attempt to understand the interaction between paired justices by arguing that motivator can generate more effect when hygiene factor or performance factors meet initial expectation. An experiment, with 3x2x2 between-subjects factorial design consisting of three factors to represent different levels of justice provided by online retailer, will be conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. A two-step approach will be used to (1) confirmation the types (hygiene, performance, or motivator) that each justice dimension belongs to, (2) understand the impact of each justice on satisfaction, and (3) test whether motivator will generate more effect when hygiene and performance factor are satisfied.

%X Social commerce is a form of commerce mediated by social media and is converging both online and offline environments. As a relatively new phenomenon, social commerce has evolved quickly in practice, yet has gained little attention in the IS discipline. With its pervasiveness in businesses and people’s lives, social commerce presents ample research opportunities that can have both theoretical and practical significance and implications. This article aims to capture researchers’ attention by describing the characteristics of social commerce and its potential future directions. We trace the evolutionary patterns of social commerce chronologically, based on trade articles and academic publications from 2005 to 2011. A framework that combines people, management, technology, and information dimensions is used to provide a systematic analysis of social commerce development. Our examination shows that since 2005, the year the term social commerce was incepted, assumptions and understanding of people in social commerce move from a simple and general description of human social nature to a rich exploration with different angles from social psychology, social heuristics, national culture, and economic situations. On the management dimension, business strategies and models evolve from the short-tail to long-tail thinking, with invented concepts such as branded social networks/communities, niche social networks/communities, niche brands, co-creating, team-buying, and multichannel social networks. Technologically, IT platforms and capabilities for social commerce evolve from blogs, to social networking sites, to media-sharing sites, and to smartphones. While Facebook becomes a profit-generating platform, creating the notion of f-commerce, Google and Twitter become strong competitors with great potentials. Information in social commerce evolves from peer-generated, to community-generated (crowdsourcing), to consumer and marketer co-created, and to global crowdsourced. Our examination identifies various conceptualizations, terminologies, views, and perspectives about social commerce and its relation to other well-known concepts such as e-commerce. In light of the evolution of social commerce, we provide possible future directions for research and practice.

%X One of the most crucial tasks for a third-party payment platform is to gain consumers’ trust to attract consumers. In previous studies, trust has been investigated in psychology, sociology, economics and many other fields. Although the third-party payment has dramatically changed human’s daily life, few empirical research has been performed to identify consumers’ trust towards a financial transaction platform. The high practical relevance and dearth of research indicate the importance of the present study. This study aims to extend Commitment-Trust theory and social network theory to propose a research model that incorporates context-specific variables as enhancing constructs to predict individuals’ trust and adoption intentions towards third-party payment platforms. To test the model, structural equation modelling is employed to analyze data collected from respondents six cities of China. The findings of this research provide managers with effective methods to promote behavior intention about Alipay and other third-party payment platforms.

%X Product sampling, a promotional tactic long employed by brands looking to enter a new market, release a new product, or increase existing sales, has recently been applied in the online context. This seems a viable strategy given the Internet’s capability to reach a wide audience and track consumer responses. Furthermore, firms may acquire product consumption experience information from the consumers who are given product samples, and use it as word-of-mouth (WOM) to further stimulate sales. However, our understanding of the effectiveness of employing this strategy in the online context is limited. By analyzing product sampling campaign data from a leading e-commerce store in China, we show that administering product sampling online can lead to increased sales, but only for experience products and not search products. Additionally, publishing product consumption experience information from product sampling (i.e., product sampling reviews), alongside usual consumer reviews, can stimulate sales of experience products directly and indirectly through enhancing subsequent consumer reviews. However, it is interesting to note that when product sampling reviews were overwhelmingly positive, they instead lowered subsequent consumer reviews. This implies that firms hoping to influence consumer reviews through positive product sampling reviews need to be wary of their negative repercussion.

%X Social commerce (s-commerce) has become rapidly appeared as relatively new area of investigation for both researchers and practitioners. However, there has been little research in the area of customer loyalty to s-commerce websites. The aim of this study is to develop a framework to identify factors affecting customers’ loyalty to s-commerce websites. A web-based survey was used to collect data which were analysed using the partial least squares based on structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). This study found that satisfaction; trust and social presence have significant influence on loyalty to s-commerce website and found that reputation, satisfaction, word-of-mouth, and social presence positively contribute to explaining the variance in trust. In contrast, communication and online shopping experience didn’t contribute to explain the variance in trust. The findings of this study contribute to the development of businesses strategies of how to retain their customers which will result in higher profits.

%X In the increasingly competitive environment between e-commerce companies, for more accurate implementation of marketing strategies, e-commerce websites often choose to subdivide the consumer market of the enterprise to identify site users’ characteristics to find their needs. In this paper, we subdivide consumer market from the four dimensions of behavior, geography, demography and psychology and propose a model to describe the characteristics of potential user market segments. Based on the web log data and user transaction data, a classification algorithm is used to analyze user behavior data in Web log to find the potential user segments and the user's descriptive characteristics in user transaction data are clustered to obtain the distribution of consumer characteristics under various product categories, then we use the product categories in e-commerce website as an intermediary to give every single potential user in potential user market segments the descriptive characteristics, which can provide data support for the realization of precision marketing. The proposed model is applied to the actual data of a certain insurance e-commerce platform, and based on the results, we gain some implications for marketing of the e-commerce website.

%X Initial trust is important, especially in the ecommerce context, for online retailers to achieve customers’ initial commitment which may lead to a more robust relationship.  For this reason, several previous studies of ecommerce focused on initial trust.  However, one problem with the previous studies is the validity of initial trust.  In this paper, we compared a three-factor model of initial trust (competence, benevolence, and integrity) with a two-factor model (competence and goodwill).  A statistical analysis with structural equation modeling indicated that the two factors of the three-factor model (i.e., benevolence and integrity) failed to provide evidence of discriminant validity.  On the other hand, the two factor model demonstrated evidence of validity and reliability of the constructs (i.e., competence and goodwill).  As an alternative to the three-factor model, therefore, the two-factor model of initial trust is presented with theoretical and practical implications.

%X Service deviation, referring to the gap between service received and perceived by customers, exists not only in physical but also in internet environments. Since customers typically evaluate service quality according to services they received and their expectations, service deviation may leads to customer dissatisfaction. Dissatisfied customers usually have intention to search for alternatives which may affect the market share and profit of abandoned service provider if turned to action. However, not all dissatisfied customers actually take action. For example, Google and Facebook receive numerous complaints, but they are still the largest sites around. In this study, we explore multiple service deviations Internet customers experience and examine why dissatisfied customers stick with e-service providers despite having contemplated deviation. Using case analysis, we collected 276 complaint cases detailing service deviation experiences on 76 e-platforms. From these cases we determined the most frequent deviation types and found that only a minority of deviations result in switching behavior. Further tests then investigate customers’ switching behavior. We hope that the findings will help e-service providers better understand the characteristics of e-service and customer behavior.

The focus of this exploratory research was to have an understanding regarding consumers’ online purchasing intentions and behaviours against existing attitudes towards online purchasing, demographic factors and existing ‘technology use’ and ‘access’. Data for the survey was collected through an online questionnaire to a purposive sample. Descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyze data. Findings of the study revealed that the consumer factor and the marketing factor remained significant between the three groups namely online store visitors, online store browsers, and online buyers. In addition to that among the online buyers marketing factor failed to remain significant against the type of goods purchased whether ‘experience goods’ or ‘search goods’.

We conducted a methodological replication of first insights and a model of the relation between satisfaction, trust, repurchase intention and the perceived effectiveness of such e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM). As we were unable to support the original findings, we provide an alternative reasoning relevant to today’s role of PEEIM for online repurchases and discuss implications for research and practice.

%X Driven by the network theory on status, we propose an interesting argument that network connection between two products affects their word-of-mouth (WOM) rating convergence and that WOM rating convergence affects their sales. To empirically validate this argument, we analyze data from China's largest business-to-consumer platform, Tmall.com. After addressing potential endogeneity issues and performing various robustness checks to ensure the consistency of our findings in various ways, we found that network connection between two products via recommender systems was related to the convergence of WOM rating between the two products. Moreover, WOM rating convergence between two products was associated with a decrease in the sales quantity of the product with higher WOM rating, whereas it was associated with an increase in the sales quantity of the product with lower WOM rating. Overall, WOM rating convergence was associated with an increase in the total sales quantity of the two products. Our findings provide important theoretical contributions and notable implications for e-commerce product marketing and platform design.

This article attempts to conceptually cluster academic literature in both management and technical domain. The study follows a framework which broadly clusters management research under two heads: OCR Assessment and OCR Implication (business implication). Parallel technical literature has been reviewed to reconcile methodologies adopted in the analysis of text content on the web, majorly reviews. Text mining through automated tools, algorithmic contribution (dominant majorly in technical stream literature) and manual assessment (derived from the stream of content analysis) has been studied in this review article. Literature survey of both the domains is analyzed to propose possible area for further research. Usage of text analysis methods along with statistical and data mining techniques to analyze review text and utilize the knowledge creation for solving managerial issues can possibly constitute further work.

%X We investigate drivers of consumer purchase decisions when shopping experience goods online, using the context of expertise literature in business topics. Based on 60,000 books from Amazon.de, we test hypotheses on the effects of (1) “brand” characteristics (author’s background, reputation, experience, demographics), (2) product characteristics (publisher, price, page count, reading excerpts, cover), and (3) social influence in terms of observational learning (OL), word-of-mouth (WOM), and expert opinions, on sales. The results demonstrate that online demand depends on a mix of these factors; yet, sales are largely determined by brand characteristics. In fact, the market’s perception of the author alters consumers’ price sensitivity and renders observable product characteristics insignificant; social influence amplifies this effect. These issues are underexplored since studies often focus on WOM effects without considering brand and product characteristics, and the relative effects of social influence, on purchase decisions. The paper shows how to target online demand more effectively.

%X Based on 60,000 books (approx. 2m purchase decisions) from Amazon.de, we analyze the interplay of four e-tailers' communication practices – presenting product networks (recommendation systems), social features (eWOM, i.e. user-generated content), free trial, and vivid content – and demonstrate how they vary in effectiveness for influencing consumers’ purchase decisions online. Additionally, little is known about effects of these practices on driving sales across the sales distribution from bestsellers to niche products. Long tail theory predicts that consumers will become particularly attracted to buying niche products as those match personal preferences better than mainstream products. However, our large-sample results are partly counter to the theoretical predictions and previous studies in the field (as both bestsellers and niche products gain sales at the expense of medium popular products). We offer a clearer understanding of the varying functionality of online communication practices that helps retail managers select, combine and focus their communication practices.

%X With the rapid development of information technology, most enterprises have built e-commerce platform, which promotes the revolution of operation mode. The focus of competition gradually becomes the customers rather than the products under the increasingly fierce market competition of the E-commerce model. Because of the non-contractual relationship between the customers and the e-commerce platform, maintaining the stable customer relationship becomes the necessary condition for the e-commerce enterprises to get profit. So predicting the customer churn accurately plays an important role in the development of e-commerce enterprises. In this paper, the BG / NBD model is used to analyze the historical transaction records of an e-commerce platform in order to analyze and predict the purchase behavior of the existing customers, and identify the pre-losing customers, which helps the enterprises to implement the more effective strategies of CRM and restore the pre-loss customers timely.

%X The purpose of this research is to explore the impact of service failure controllability on consumer purchase behavior and to clarify the moderating role of relationship strength. Our conceptual model posits that high levels of firm controllability are associated with negative customer reactions. In addition, we examine two opposing hypotheses discussed in literature: the "love becomes hate" and the "love is blind" effect. We base our analysis on an extensive data set provided by a leading European online retailer that includes more than 14,000 complaints and 165,000 orders. Our research emphasizes the relevance of attribution theory in the context of actual consumer behavior and confirms that high levels of firm controllability are associated with negative consumer reactions. The empirical results further show that a strong customer-organization relationship mitigates the negative effects of service failures independently of the level of firm controllability. Therefore, the "love is blind" effect is strongly supported.

We identify six segments into which the daily deal shoppers can be categorized: recreational shoppers, mobile shoppers, traditionalists, bargain hunters, socializers, and convenience seekers. These clusters are distinctively different in terms of shopping motives, online behavior, and demographics. By following these clusters, our research maps for the first time the field of daily deal shopping in Switzerland. Our findings have implications for business, as they suggest how to best serve different segments to enhance the customer experience, and for research, as they complement daily deal literature by identifying daily deal shopper segments.

To figure out the question, two important features of O2O commerce, i.e., offline experience and the integration of online and offline information, were incorporated into an empirical model to examine their influences on the technology and economics attributes of O2O commerce from the perspective of consumers. The two features were confirmed to exert significant impacts on consumer’s acceptance of O2O commerce. Finally, the implication and the direction of future study were discussed.

%X This paper examines the effects of Web 2.0 experience, especially the social networking and interaction orientation factors, which are likely to influence online consumers’ purchase intention and buying behaviour. Based on theoretical foundations of what has been identified as Web 2.0 experience, this study proposes a research model consisting of these two factors acting as the main parameters influencing online purchase intention. These antecedents are modeled as first-order constructs with reflective indicators. The model is empirically tested by analysing the results of data from an anonymous survey of 167 students under a real Web 2.0 online shopping environment. Statistical analyses using structural equation modeling (SEM) are used to validate the model and identify the relative importance of the key antecedents to online purchase intention. On the one hand, the results confirm the direct positive influence of the interaction orientation factor on purchase intention. On the other, they suggest that the relationship between the social networking factor and intention to buy is mediated by the interaction orientation factor.

%X Today’s technological advancements enable marketers to track consumer touch points in great detail. We analyze the users’ sequence of visits to a website (off-site clickstreams) as it gives insights into the overall decision-making process of consumers on their path to purchase or non-purchase. We show that search patterns based on the online advertising channel choice discloses specific shopping types. Operationalizing search behavior as navigational or informational based on information retrieval research and the level of consumer involvement; we use k-means clustering to categorize search pat-terns as Buying, Searching, Browsing or Bouncing. Our typology is based on a unique and compre-hensive dataset from a leading European fashion e-commerce company and includes a total of almost 30 million clickstream journeys based on over 80 million lines of clicks from 11 advertising channels. This paper is the first to link the off-site online channel journey of consumers with their underlying search patterns to establish a typology of search types in a large-scale setting. Understanding the na-ture and characteristics of online consumer search and its implications for consideration and choice is also of high importance from a managerial perspective as our results offer e-marketers the ability to make inferences for automated marketing system decision-making.

%X Merchant reputation is a collective measure of trustworthiness derived from a combination of received referrals and consumer past purchase experience. The positive influence of merchant reputation on consumers’ responses and attitudes has received much attention, particularly in terms of the connection between trust and merchant reputation. This paper focuses on how merchant reputation shapes consumer decision-making in online shopping, through an analysis of the perceptions of a select group of online consumers and merchants. The research reveals that merchant reputation has more influence on consumer confidence and trust than on the decision to shop online, but only if it is directly supported by peer recommendations and feedback. Indeed, reputation has a direct influence on consumer confidence and trust, which then indirectly affects the decision to shop online.

%X The Information Systems literature has substantially advanced understanding of online review helpfulness in both its antecedents and consequences. Despite the rich understanding, existing studies predominately focused on the impact of coarser-grained characteristics on consumer’s helpfulness perception. The possibility of evaluating review’s helpfulness based on both fine-grained textual information along with multiple general factors of reviewer and products challenged existing understanding. While textual features such as latent topics and semantic traits of a review have been considered as effective predictors for identifying helpful reviews, the causal effects of these predictors on review’s perceived helpfulness still remain largely unclear. Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this proposal focuses on understanding how coarse-grained general characteristics and finegrained textual characteristics jointly affect the perceived helpfulness of online review. In particular, following the spirit of ELM, we propose a model to disentangle the types of online review characteristics through a dual information processing perspective, and investigate how consumer’s motivation moderates effect of the two information processing routes. The proposed research model shall be operationalized by employing a panel data analysis.

%X The present work aims to identify the interrelations among trust, privacy, emotions and experience in order to predict high purchase intentions, when using personalized services in the area of e-commerce. Building on complexity theory we present a conceptual model followed by research propositions. Our propositions are empirically validated through a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) on 182 customers with experience in personalized online shopping. The results indicate five configurations of trust, privacy, emotions, and experience that explain high purchase intentions. The importance of trust and happiness should be noted since they are both present most frequently as core factors. The study has both theoretical and practical implications towards the development of new emotion-centric theories and the design and provision of personalized services.

%X With the advancement of information technology, many innovations have emerged from the development of the Internet, including online shopping and social commerce. However, online consumers constantly experience some degree of uncertainty, such as potentially untrustworthy sellers, difficult transaction processes, and unknown new technologies and goods. Trust addresses the problem of risks in these uncertain situations. This study uses attribution theory to investigate the trust of Indonesian consumers in individual sellers. This trust is proposed to be determined by the congruence between buyer–seller personality and online servicescapes in the context of social commerce. Findings and contributions of this study are discussed as well.

%X How do consumers assess product quality when confronted with multiple cues? This study examines the dissimilar use of product information cues in product evaluations of Web sites. The cue diagnosticity framework is then used to assess the effects of antecedents - engagement, risk, and positive and negative emotions - on consumer cognitive processing and online impulsive purchase. Therefore, four experiments were designed to test the effects of extrinsic cues—ranking and sales—on consumers’ purchase intention. Data collected from 160 customers provide strong support for the research model. The implications of the findings are discussed along with directions for future research.

%X  As Chinese game market growing mature, cultivating loyal game users has become the new goals for game companies. Based on the theory of game users experience, this paper constructs the structural model of customer with the variables of perceived value, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty and studies the relationship between the game users’ hedonic/utilitarian value and customer satisfaction/customer loyalty from the perspective of the game user utilitarian value and hedonic value. The study finds that the game users’ perceived value has a positive effect on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty; while hedonic value has a more significant effect on customer satisfaction than utilitarian value, the latter one has a greater significant effect on customer loyalty than the former one; customer satisfaction has a positive effect on customer loyalty; hedonic value and utilitarian value interact and influence with each other. Implication and recommendation of this research is that enhancing the hedonic and utilitarian value of game users by game companies which is one of the effective ways to improve game users’ satisfaction and loyalty.

%X Although Internet retailing has become part of mainstream commerce, there is still lack of web-interface design strategies as a function of price of product, complexity of product, and personal involvement of consumer with the product. Different types of products require different aspects of information and environment as demanded by consumers; thus, it is imperative for retailers to appropriately tailor their online presentation of products. Drawing from the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we intend to investigate the effectiveness of peripheral-cue dominated interfaces, balanced-cue dominated interfaces, and central-cue dominated interfaces on consumer purchase intentions. Our initial analyses provide support for the contention that the role of website cues (peripheral and central) on the consumer varies by the type of product. Our findings have implications for research and practice. We intend to provide greater insights into our results in our presentation at the conference.

%X Mobile commerce (m-commerce) is becoming more prominent with the advancement in mobile devices and the trend is showing that m-commerce can be truly profitable for businesses. This has led to the question on how customer knowledge management (CKM) tools in m-commerce platform can assist businesses in influencing customers’ intention to use m-commerce to purchase products or services more frequently. Furthermore, the research is also attempting to look into the determinants of mcommerce purchase intention by employing the Lazy User Theory (LUT) with relations to existing technology-adoption models such as TAM and UTAUT. The theory is centred on the principal of least effort which assumed that the users will intend to use m-commerce platforms on mobile devices to purchase products or service as it will require less effort on the user to perform compared to conventional e-commerce. The literature on the theoretical foundations of CKM and LUT, along with proposed research methodology and theoretical framework are presented.

%X E-commerce marketing plays an important role in the development of e-commerce. However, many e-commerce marketing types are obscure, excessive and exaggerated. If some consumers buy and use inappropriate products or services, the consumers may suffer from greater losses. As a result, these marketing types are not sustainable, and also hinder the development of e-commerce. Research on optimizing and restructuring the e-commerce marketing has important practical significance. The article analyzes and studies existing e-commerce marketing according to the interests of all parties and aim to result in a win-win situation. We introduce the ideas and methods from the Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to optimize and restructure e-commerce marketing. Finally, we discuss the characteristics, content and process of the e-commerce sustainable marketing and give some discussions on its real applications.

%X Since the introduction of the e-commerce poverty alleviation, e-commerce poverty alleviation has been carried out in the counties. Luotian County is a demonstration county in e-commerce poverty alleviation, which is at the forefront of poverty reduction counties in Hubei Province. Playing the leading role of the county level government, Luotian County established the e-commerce industrial park and the village-level service station, developed the e-commerce industry and opened up the rural logistics. Giving full play to the main role of the market, the county also focused on developing agricultural industrialization enterprises, expanded sales channels with e-commerce, drove the development of featured industries, promoted the growth of the industrial chain, and shared the benefits of the poor households. Besides, it also promoted e-commerce tourism and helped poverty-stricken families get rid of poverty. The paper mainly analyzes the main practice and achievements of e-commerce in Luotian County and summarizes the experience of Luotian e-commerce in poverty alleviation, with a view to providing reference for other counties and regions.

%X Online intermediary plays an important role in e-commerce nowadays. Traditionally, it serves as a merchant buying goods from manufacturers and reselling them to consumer. With the development of technology, more and more intermediaries choose to become platforms referring consumers to sellers. It is critical for an intermediary to decide which model to adopt. To address this question, we establish a game-theoretic model with an intermediary and multiple manufacturers competing in selling heterogeneous products. Our analysis indicates that as the heterogeneity among products decreases, either at the production or the consumer side, the intermediary prefers the platform model to the merchant model. Nevertheless, if the products are highly similar, and thus the competition at the retail market is highly intense, the merchant model will be a better choice.

%X This research aims to investigate the process and factors for developing customer loyalty through eservice quality experience. Based on previous studies on e-loyalty and loyalty, we developed an integrated model of e-loyalty antecedent factors by testing the eTailQ scale including website quality, security/privacy, value perception, reliability and customer support which are mediated through trust and satisfaction. Data was collected from 140 e-commerce users and analyzed with Lisrel 8.8. The analysis result demonstrated that eTailQ scale is effective in developing customer loyalty and both satisfaction and trust has played important roles in shaping the e-loyalty development process. However, contradictory to the traditional loyalty study, customer support does not play a significant role in e-loyalty development process.

%X The effects of e-commerce institutional mechanisms on trust and online purchase have traditionally been understood in the initial online purchase context.  This study extends this literature by exploring the role of e-commerce institutional mechanisms in the online repurchase context.  In doing so, it responds to the emerging call for understanding the institutional context under which customer trust operates in an e-commerce environment.  Specifically, this study introduces a key moderator, perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM), to the relationships between trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intention.  Drawing on the theory of organizational trust, and based on a survey of 362 returning online customers, we find that PEEIM negatively moderates the relationship between trust in an online vendor and online customer repurchase intention, as it decreases the importance of trust to promoting repurchase behavior.  We also find that PEEIM positively moderates the relationship between customer satisfaction and trust as it enhances the customer’s reliance on past transaction experience with the vendor to reevaluate trust in the vendor.  Consistent with the predictions made in the literature, PEEIM does not directly affect trust or repurchase intention.  Academic and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

%X This study investigates into factors affecting the success of E-service using a research model grounded on the Updated DeLone and McLean Information System Success Model (DeLone & McLean, 2003). Fourteen factors originated from four constructs, i.e., system quality, information quality, service quality, and vendor dimensions, are included in our research model. Using the online music subscription industry in Hong Kong as the platform of our investigation, we examine the associations between these four constructs and customer preference in the online music subscription service industry in Hong Kong. We collected data from 135 college students from Hong Kong to test our model using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). We show that each E-business success construct in our model has different levels of importance in E-service success in the online music subscription service industry. Our findings provide decision makers of E-business firms with useful insights to enhance their E-service quality.

%X The growth of online commerce has given consumers a number of convenient options to shop from. This has led to the proliferation of e-commerce players that offer variety of products and services with customer-centric terms and conditions. However, absence of avenues to test the product(s) before buying, shoppers perceive inherent risk associated with online buying, especially related to products’ quality and features, terms and conditions of sales, etc. To overcome this pre-purchase dissonance and compensate for the lack of previous experience, they look for reliable information and guidance. Hence, to make decisions, e-buyers rely on the reviews provided by other shoppers. Therefore, it becomes imperative for e-retailers to determine antecedent factors that influence the adoption of online reviews. Using heuristic-systematic model, this study has identified the relative significance of information credibility, argument quality, quantity sufficiency and source credibility in influencing the adoption of reviews available online. It was observed that the two categories of influencers impact the reviews’ adoption albeit through the two mediators - perceived usefulness and perceived value of reviews. Theoretical and practical implications have also been highlighted.

%X This study presents a respecification of the DeLone and McLean IS success model and empirically assesses it to predict customers’ future purchases in the context of the online grocery store. Survey data were collected from 376 customers of one online grocery store. Structural equation modeling was conducted to validate the research model. The results indicate that service quality, product quality, and perceived ease of use are significant predictors of user satisfaction with the online grocery store. Additionally, user satisfaction, service quality, product quality, and perceived ease of use are significant predictors of customer future intentions to repurchase groceries from the online grocery store. The results may be of importance in explaining factors that measure success of the online grocery store, as well as in providing operators of the online grocery service with a better understanding of how to maintain customer loyalty.

%X Cross-border e-commerce has become an important channel for promoting international trade. Yet, the factors influencing buyer behavior in cross-border e-commerce have received relatively less research attention than in domestic e-commerce settings. In this paper we draw on the valence framework to develop and test a research model of buyer repeat purchase intentions in cross-border e-commerce. We hypothesized the effects of positive valences (value, monetary saving, convenience and product offerings) along with negative valences (product and transaction-based uncertainties) on repeat purchase intention. Data was collected from users of a popular cross-border e-commerce provider in China. Results (n=169) revealed that positive valences exert the strongest effects on repeat purchase intention, but negative valences are also significant. These include product-based uncertainties and transaction-based uncertainties. Our model explained 69% of the variance in repeat purchase intentions in a cross-border e-commerce platform. Results enhance our understanding of cross-border e-commerce and have important implications for online providers competing in international markets.

%X Online product reviews, originally intended to reduce consumers’ pre-purchase search and evaluation costs, have become so numerous that they are now themselves a source for information overload. To help consumers find high-quality reviews faster, review rankings based on consumers’ evaluations of their helpfulness were introduced. But many reviews are never evaluated and never ranked. Moreover, current helpfulness-based systems provide little or no advice to reviewers on how to write more helpful reviews. Average review quality and consumer search costs could be much improved if these issues were solved. This requires identifying the determinants of review helpfulness, which we carry out based on an adaption of Wang and Strong’s well-known data quality framework. Our empirical analysis shows that review helpfulness is influenced not only by single-review features but also by contextual factors expressing review value relative to all available reviews. Reviews for experiential goods differ systematically from reviews for utilitarian goods. Our findings, based on 27,104 reviews from Amazon.com across six product categories, form the basis for estimating preliminary helpfulness scores for unrated reviews and for developing interactive, personalized review writing support tools.

%X At present time and state of the market where businesses and organizations are striving hard to survive and improve performance due to high availability of similar products and services, business processes or products are playing less and less significant role when it comes to differentiate oneself from the others. As a result, more and more firms are leaning towards selecting one or a few distinctive capabilities on which they base their strategies on and then apply extensive quantitative analysis to support the selected capability. In this paper we have examined how analytics is delivering values for various internal and external processes. Form an internal view point, processes related to financial, manufacturing, research and development, and human resources are significantly using analytics. From an external process view point, analytics is presently used in client relations, marketing, supply chain optimizations and in few other processes. We have presented the business functions in different industries that are currently generating insight from analytics and also pointed out areas that could benefit from an analytical approach. In conclusion, we have drawn attention to the challenges that are inevitable when embarking on the analytical journey and commented on the approach that should be taken.

%X Consumers' trust beliefs are considered amongst the most important psychological states influencing their online behaviour. Understanding the antecedents of consumer trust is thus of both academic and practical interest. Research into these antecedents has however been disconnected, and has not been integrated to provide an answer as to which are the most significant antecedents of trust. To address this problem, we synthesized the antecedents of trust in e-service through a meta-analysis of 59 previously published studies. The findings showed that structural assurance (STA), reputation (REP), and perceived usefulness (PU) demonstrate the strongest effect sizes on trust. Furthermore, vendor size (SIZ) and privacy protection (PRC) also affect trust, but to a lesser degree. We considered explanations for identified heterogeneity in effect sizes through moderator analysis. We found that cultural context of the study moderated all the effect sizes, and certain effect sizes were also moderated by factors such as the type of e-service and the use of student samples. Results are important to guiding future e-services research.

%X Information privacy concerns a person’s right to access and control personal data. Advances in technologies like smart phones, beacons, and video surveillance influence a customer’s privacy in both physical spheres and online shopping. We wanted to investigate: What kind of information do retailers accumulate from in-store versus online shopping, and how does this affect their customers’ information privacy? We interviewed managers at large retailers that have both physical and online stores. As anticipated, we found that case companies accumulate more data from online than in-store shopping, however the retailers are in the process of integrating data from both sources. We make the following contributions: (i) an updated mapping of Norwegian retailers’ exploitation of technology and customer data, and (ii) the following argument: Mason’s PAPA framework from 1986 still addresses the main issues regarding companies’ data collection from both online and physical stores. However, we need to focus on how companies handle the information. Pertaining to this, we offer two guidelines for retail managers. This study should be of interest to researchers within privacy, Business Intelligence, Big Data, and Data Science. It is also relevant for retail managers and customers both inside and outside Norwegian borders.

Although research has examined various factors behind customer online review posting behaviour, the role of online reviews in further propagating online reviews has not been given enough attention. In this study, we use the expectation-confirmation theory for examining customer review posting behaviour based on their examination of online reviews from other shoppers. The study reveals a few interesting and counter-intuitive findings that add to research and practice in understanding online review posting behaviour.  The study also examines the role of review involvement and its effect on shoppers’ behaviour. The results show that shoppers are more inclined to write reviews when confirmation leads to lower satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications based on the findings have also been presented.

%X Extracting actionable information from complex data is a key challenge for business analytics researchers (Hedgebeth, 2007). This is particularly difficult for high-dimensional datasets, to which an increasing number of businesses have access (Martens et al., 2016). In this study, we develop a customized neural network for extracting interpretable features from very high-dimensional datasets. These features can be interpreted both at an aggregated as well as a very fine-grained level. Interpreting non-linear interactions is no more difficult than interpreting a linear regression. We apply the algorithm to a dataset related to product returns in online retail which contains a total of 3,637,654 transactions and 13,533 dimensions. Comparing 75 different models, we demonstrate that, in addition to being interpretable, our algorithm yields higher predictive accuracy than extant methods. The approach is sufficiently abstract to be applicable to a wide variety of business analytics datasets.

%X O2O, an acronym of online-to-offline or vice versa, is a new business model blending online retailing with offline retailing. This new model improves an existing method of shopping by either integrating the online components for traditional shoppers or the traditional shopping for Internet or mobile shoppers. Few studies have examined consumers’ acceptance of new O2O business model. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate consumer acceptance of O2O business model from the status quo bias and habit perspectives that have been used to examine new system acceptance by past research. Using a sample data collected from 230 respondents, this study applies a structural equation model (SEM) to examine the relationships of the proposed research model. The results reveal that behavioural-based inertia positively impacts perceived ease of use and cognitive-based inertia positively impacts relative advantage, and consequently impacts consumers’ intention to use O2O shopping. In addition, subjective norm positively impacts perceived ease of use and relative advantage, and self-efficacy positively impacts perceived ease of use. Because O2O shopping is a consumer’s adoption of a new business model which involves information technologies and retailing services, this study thus provides in depth insights into enhancing the acceptance of both new information technologies and new business model. Particularly, inertia can facilitate consumers O2O shopping acceptance as opposed to inhibit new system acceptance found in past research. Perceived ease of use and relative advantage fully mediate the relationships between external variables (such as inertia, subjective norm, and self-efficacy) and O2O shopping intention. Implications are drawn for electronic commerce, mobile commerce, and retailing.

%X Many previous studies assessed the adoption of mobile shopping by employing technology adoption models such as Technology Adoption Model (TAM), Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). However, there has been a lack of effort in re-assessing the usage of these models for investigating mobile shopping adoption through the aspect of the advantages offered by mobile devices, compared to desktop devices. Furthermore, a new outlook into the aspect of customer behavior on mobile shopping is required as mobile technology continues to advance and progress within the context of the online shopping environment. The objective of this paper is to propose a new aspect to identify mobile shopping behavioral intention where the theoretical foundation of convenience and utilitarian advantages of mobile devices over PCs are taken into consideration. The paper suggests a conceptual framework where these variables will be discussed based on the fundamental variables. The framework will assist in improving the mobile platform to encourage more mobile shoppers in the future.

%X Owing to the lack of human bandwidth online, feedback systems have been introduced as a means of providing information on quality. Existing studies on the effects of ratings systems have had conflicting results. With this in mind, this study investigates the relative contribution of information according to search cost. It focuses on Groupon, based on its unique provision of daily deals, most of which are local and unique services not sold elsewhere and limited to a single day. In cases like that of Groupon, in which usable information for evaluating product quality is limited and search costs are high, consumers may rely on less persuasive information, such as others’ preferences and ratings. Using Groupon data, this paper confirms that under conditions of high search cost, pure preference can positively influence actual sales. It also finds that this effect is magnified as search cost increases.

%X Internet banking service (IBS) is transforming the traditional ways of customer banking. Although IBS is very common in developed countries, however, its adoption by customers in developing countries is still very slow. This may well be due to the lack of customer’s trust in IBS in developing countries. This paper studies the important issue of customer’s initial trust in IBS in the Jordanian context and proposes the customer initial trust model. The objective of this model is to understand and analyse the underlying factors that affect the early stage of trust (i.e. initial customer trust) in IBS, which may, impact customer’s initial intention to use IBS. The proposed model of customer’s initial trust in IBS integrates constructs from Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) theory, Hofstede culture theory and trust literature. The distinguishable property of this model is the incorporation of national culture dimensions on initial trust. The proposed model will assist Jordanian banks in understanding the factors that may impact their customers’ initial trust in IBS.

%X Predicting customer purchase behaviour is an interesting and challenging task. In e-commerce context, to tackle the challenge will confront a lot of new problems different from those in traditional business. This study investigates three factors that affect purchasing decision-making of customers in online shopping: the needs of customers, the popularity of products and the preference of the customers. Furthermore, exploiting purchase data and ratings of products in the e-commerce website, we propose methods to quantify the strength of these factors: (1) using associations between products to predict the needs of customers; (2) combining collaborative filtering and a hierarchical Bayesian discrete choice model to learn preference of customers; (3) building a support vector regression based model, called Heat model, to calculate the popularity of products; (4) developing a crowdsourcing approach based experimental platform to generate train set for learning Heat model. Combining these factors, a model, called COREL, is proposed to make purchase behaviour prediction for customers. Submitted a purchased product of a customer, the model can return top n the most possible purchased products of the customer in future. Experiments show that these factors play key roles in predictive model and COREL can greatly outperform the baseline methods.

%X An e-retailer sponsored virtual community (ESVC), as the backyard of an e-commerce website, provides consumers with an online platform to play with each other. It also facilitates consumer-to-e-retailer communications. How to drive value from consumer participation in ESVC becomes important in this context. In this research, the role of personal reciprocity as the mediator between a consumer’s satisfaction with ESVC and consumer loyalty toward e-retailers was investigated. Questionnaires were distributed through an online survey. A pilot analysis was performed based on limited data collection. Results, limitations and future directions are discussed.

%X As many people have adopted mobile applications for their hand-held devices, mobile applications are becoming widely used in everyday life.  Nonetheless, some applications are used only few times and then abandoned.  Particular since many firms have launched mobile applications for communicating with and delivering their products or services to customers, user retentions toward mobile applications can be critical.  To address this challenge, we identify how design characteristics of mobile application enhance user retention toward mobile applications, particularly in the context of cross-channel commerce.  Drawing on an environmental psychology, we address that user beliefs stimulated by environmental cues (e.g., design characteristics) affect users’ cognitive and affective internal states, which in turn lead to their retention toward mobile applications.  Contributions of this study include 1) theoretically, a suggested theoretical framework for effective mobile application design as an extension of website design, and (2) practically, helping practitioners to articulate effective mobile applications or the Internet strategy in mobile-based online markets.

%X In the 21st century the quantity of research on personalization has grown exponentially. New technologies enable efficient interaction with customers, even on one-to-one basis, providing the right content in the right format to the right person at the right time. The latest developments with “big data” analytics promise unprecedented opportunities for personalization, even in real-time. Although the technological advances allow fancy enhancements in personalization, it is imperative that the context-specific customer attitudes towards online personalization are taken into account by businesses. Customers are increasingly aware of their privacy, which improper personalization may intrude.
%X This article presents the results of a two-phase study. Focus group interviews uncovered first the perceptions of bank customers regarding personalized marketing communication on online bank. A subsequent exploratory study investigated the online behaviour of customers, that is, their genuine responses to personalized messages. In this phase, bank customers were shown personalized banner advertisements when they logged in to their bank service. We studied, among others, the click-through rates and navigational behaviour and compared the effectiveness of personalized banners to default banners, and to traditional direct-mail messages. The personalized banners attracted more attention than default banners. In two of the three cases, the actual sales were also higher than in the case of direct-mail promotion. The results offer implications both for research and practice.

%X When shopping online, consumers have to decide between two vendor types – suppliers and intermediaries. The existing body of research on intermediation usually adopts a market-centric perspective, and subsequently neglects the consumer when making this focal decision. Therefore, using the example of digital music, we offer a consumer-centric view on this problem. We use experimental and simulation techniques to analyze how consumers decide between intermediaries and suppliers and what kind of search strategies they apply. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency of consumers’ decisions and find significant differences between strategies. Given that in practice, consumers usually possess less information on products and prices prior to search and that market structures are more complex, our study demonstrates that consumers may suffer from efficiency losses when having to make such decisions. This highlights the importance of consumer decision support systems that operate on a market-spanning basis and provides new insights for practical applications.

%X Chinese C2C market grows rapidly. However, it is plagued by serious trust fraud problems. The level of price dispersion in C2C platforms is relatively high. The mixed interaction between “lemons market” problem and high level of price dispersion makes it hard for buyers to identify trustworthy sellers with low price. We are interested in the generation of initial trust and purchase intention when the buyers search a product and receive a list of widely distributed prices, rather than a list of narrowly distributed prices. However, limited knowledge can be gained from previous studies regarding this issue. This study puts forward a theoretical model to explain how price dispersion interacts with other important factors in C2C purchase (e.g. initial trust, perceived risk, perceived value and purchase intention). Product type (high- touch/low-touch) is taken into consideration as well since the level of uncertainty faced by buyers is different. A proposal for experiment is described. This research-in-progress has the potential to lead to various theoretical and practical implications. For example, the results will enhance the literature on trust, help buyers do better purchase decision, assist sellers in designing pricing strategy, and be utilized by platforms to propose new mechanisms.

%X As the technologies and better practices become broadly available, companies are moving more quickly from a single-click or search-only model toward greater sophisticated models of informing and influencing the customer online shopping journeys. This study scrutinizes the predictive relationship between three referral channels, search engine, social medial, and third-party advertising, and online consumer search and purchase. The results derived from vector autoregressive models suggest that the three channels have differential predictive relationship with sale measures. Such differential relationship is even more pronounced for the long-term, accumulative effects. The predictive power of the three channels is also considerably different in referring customers among competing online shopping websites. This study offers new insights for IT and marketing practitioners in respect to how different channels perform in order to optimize the media mix and overall performance.

%X This paper builds on academic and industry discussions from the 2012 and 2013 pre-ICIS events: BI Congress III and the Special Interest Group on Decision Support Systems (SIGDSS) workshop, respectively. Recognizing the potential of “big data” to offer new insights for decision making and innovation, panelists at the two events discussed how organizations can use and manage big data for competitive advantage. In addition, expert panelists helped to identify research gaps. While emerging research in the academic community identifies some of the issues in acquiring, analyzing, and using big data, many of the new developments are occurring in the practitioner community. We bridge the gap between academic and practitioner research by presenting a big data analytics framework that depicts a process view of the components needed for big data analytics in organizations. Using practitioner interviews and literature from both academia and practice, we identify the current state of big data research guided by the framework and propose potential areas for future research to increase the relevance of academic research to practice.

%X This study aims to explain how value co-creation, between customers and companies, and key aspects of trust combine to influence customers’ purchase intentions in social commerce. Value co-creation is decomposed into two attributes, behavioral alignment, and empowerment and control, while trust is measured through the aspects of trusting beliefs, institutional trust, and disposition to trust. In order to examine the interplay of these factors and their combined effect on purchase intentions in social commerce, a conceptual model is developed and examined on a data sample of 379 users with experience in social commerce, through fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings indicate five configurations that lead to high intentions to purchase in social commerce, and three configurations that inhibit purchase intentions. The outcomes of the analysis show that value co-creation may be more important than trust in achieving high purchase intentions, while avoiding low/medium purchase intentions. This study contributes to the social commerce literature by demonstrating how value co-creation and trust interrelate and how their interplay influences purchase intentions.

%X Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) e-marketplaces cannot survive without participations from both a large number of buyers and sellers. Prior research on trust in e-commerce is mainly conducted from the buyers’ perspective. Combined with TAM constructs, this research explores the relative impacts of trust in terms of trust in market-maker and institution-based trust, and risk on individual’s transaction intentions in C2C e-marketplaces from both buyers’ and sellers’ perspectives. The results suggest that the major determinants of transaction intention in e-marketplaces differ between buyer and sellers. Perceived risk is found to have a stronger effect on sellers’ intention than on buyers’ intention to transact in e-marketplaces. In addition, we found that perceived usefulness influences only buyers’ transaction intention, whereas institution-based trust and perceived ease of use influence only sellers’ transaction intention. This study contributes theoretically to C2C e-commerce research and has practical implications for C2C e-commerce practitioners.

%X While online shopping websites are facing the difficulties of price and low-quality competition, cross- border online shopping is on a vigorous development trend, showing that cross-border online shopping is an important trend of online shopping field. Due to the complexity of cross-border online shopping is much higher than the traditional domestic online shopping, so understanding the value of cross-border online shopping consumers is the most important success factors. Companies want to develop new markets abroad, must understand the local consumer’s behaviour and their decision-making process in order to make good business strategies. This study uses means-end chain to construct Taiwanese cross-border online shopping consumers’ hierarchical value map, and also uses Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to sort these value elements’ importance. After obtained the reason why consumers use cross-border online shopping service and what values they got in this service. Researcher can predict and analyse the evolution and development of cross- border online shopping, provide reference for future online shopping academic studies and online shopping industry’s decision-making.

%X The social commerce represents a new form of electronic commerce mediated by social networking sites. It provides companies with competitive tools for online promotion, and it also assists consumers to make better-informed purchasing decisions based on the sharing of experiences from other consumers. Trust is important in social commerce environment as it serves as a foundation for consumers to evaluate product information from companies as well as from other consumers. However, extant literature still lacks clear understanding of the nature of trust in social commerce. This study sets out to understand trust development in social commerce websites. Specifically, based on trust transference theory, we develop a research model to examine how consumer trust in social commerce impacts their trust in the company and their electronic word of mouth intention. In addition, we also examine how customers’ prior transaction experience with a company could impact their social commerce trust development and serve as a mediator in the trust transfer process. The research model is empirically examined using a survey method consisting of 375 users of a social commerce website. This study contributes to the conceptual and empirical understanding of trust in social commerce. The academic and practical implications of this study are also discussed.

%X Given the enormous growth and significant impacts of group buying on Internet business marketplaces, understanding what motivates consumer online group buying (OGB) behavior is crucial. Drawing from Uses and Gratifications (U&G) perspective, this study investigates consumers’ motivations for using OGB. The laddering interview technique is used to interview 52 online group buyers and to capture the various needs they are seeking to gratify through OGB behavior, with grounded theory used to determine motivation categories. In total 16 motivations were identified from data analysis. The findings suggest that consumers are motivated by various factors to use OGB. Additionally, it is found that there are a few different motivations in OGB context compared to other e-business model contexts. This study has the potential to make significant theoretical contributions to IS discipline and e-business regarding consumer OGB behavior. Moreover, the results can benefit both OGB vendors and suppliers planning to promote their sales through OGB.

%X Despite the overwhelming prediction of increasing trends for mobile shopping activities among customers based on the advantages provided by the mobile shopping channel, there is an urgent need for the re-assessment on the roles of technology adoption models and theories in explaining the adoption of mobile shopping among customers. Moreover, there is a lack of empirical testing for investigating the influence of the multidimensional convenience construct on customers’ mobile shopping adoption based upon the utilitarian motivations, where convenience is one of the main antecedents for utilitarian-based customers to use a particular shopping channel. The objective of this paper is to propose a conceptual framework that attempts to explain the mobile shopping adoption of customers by focusing on the unique advantages of mobile devices over PC that allows for better online shopping experience for customers. This study will look into the possibility of synthesizing different adoption models (TAM, UTAUT and IDT) and their constructs into a single cohesive theoretical framework that would be able to explain the mobile shopping channel adoption of customers through the unique characteristics that the channel possess over PC-based online shopping. The paper has identified several theories and concepts (Lazy User Theory, utilitarianism and utilitarian shopping motivations) which fit such requirements. Furthermore, this paper will also employ the multidimensional construct of convenience within the framework in order to explain the mobile shopping adoption intention of customers.

%X Social commerce, the application of social media to support e-commerce transactions, is becoming a lucrative means for e-commerce companies to increase their sales volumes. To achieve this goal, companies today can extend their e-commerce websites with a wide range of diverse social commerce features. Hence, knowledge is required how the integration of certain social commerce features stimulates consumers to adopt social commerce websites and which features might deliver the highest benefits in a particular scenario. However, current literature provides little insight about how concrete social commerce features influence the consumers’ willingness to adopt social commerce websites. To contribute to the closure of this research gap, we propose a research model that allows evaluating the impacts of social commerce features on the consumers’ adoption of social commerce websites in a systematic, comparable manner. Therefore, the research model integrates several adoption factors, taking into account utilitarian, hedonic, relational, and social determinants. We also describe how the hypotheses contained in our research model can be evaluated in an experimental setting. In so doing, we expect our research to contribute to achieving a better understanding of how certain social commerce features can improve the design of social commerce websites.

This study first summarized initiatives that Alibaba has launched to stimulate the use of “Ant Check Later”. Three factors, bonus, quota lifting, and scenario enrichment, were then distinguished from the initiatives using principal component analysis. These factors were anticipated to affect consumers’ intention to use the service. The research model was tested using 373 respondents collected from an online survey. Results indicate that bonus, quota lifting, and scenario enrichment are three predictors of consumers’ intention to continue using the service, and bonus and scenario enrichment positively affect non-users’ intention to use the service. This study found that scenario enrichment is the most important factor among the three factors in boosting consumers’ behavioral intention toward using the service.  Keywords E-commerce consumer credit services, bonus, quota lifting, scenario enrichment, acceptance.

%X An online recommendation system (RS) involves using information technology and customer information to tailor electronic commerce interactions between a business and individual customers. Extant information systems (IS) studies on RS have approached the phenomenon from many different perspectives, and our understanding of the nature and impacts of RS is fragmented. The current study reviews and synthesizes extant empirical IS studies to provide a coherent view of research on RS and identify gaps and future directions. Specifically, we review 40 empirical studies of RS published in 31 IS journals and five IS conference proceedings between 1990 and 2013. Using a recommendation process theoretical framework, we categorize these studies in three major areas addressed by RS research: understanding consumers, delivering recommendations, and the impacts of RS. We review and synthesize the extant literature in each area and across areas. Based on the review and synthesis, we surface research gaps and provide suggestions and potential directions for future research on recommendation systems.

%X Owing to the increased competition in electronic markets, customer loyalty has become an important success factor in e-business. However, the antecedents of customer loyalty differ between business domains. While the formation of customer loyalty in e-commerce has been studied extensively, little is known about how loyalty towards news websites develops. Integrating findings from uses and gratifications research into DeLone and McLean’s theory on information systems success, we built a quality-value-satisfaction-loyalty chain for news websites. To test our research model, we conducted a survey and applied partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results reveal that loyalty towards news websites depends on both utilitarian and hedonic value perceptions, which, in turn, are influenced by content quality. Our study combines communication, information systems, as well as marketing research theories and has important implications for news website providers.

%X With the emergence of online pictorial reviews, reviewer’s image becomes available information for later-buyers. But whether and how reviewer’s image would influence consumers’ product evaluation still remains unclear. In this study, we investigate how reviewer attractiveness, a newly available reviewer attribute enabled by pictorial reviews, would interact with two existing attributes of textual reviews (i.e., review valence and review depth) in influencing consumers’ purchase intention. In particular, drawing on the Source Effect Models, we hypothesize that reviewer attractiveness would only influence consumers’ purchase intention when review valence is positive, and propose that review depth would moderate the image attractiveness effect. Lab experiments are designed to test our hypotheses. This study contributes to the online review literature by investigating reviewer attractiveness effect in online pictorial reviews. It also extends the source effect literature to the user-generated online review context. It provides important practical implications for online retailers and online review participants.

%X Smartphone-based m-commerce enables customers to purchase products in different channels. In the complicated mobile shopping channels, retaining existing customers becomes important. In light of these developments, this study focuses on crucial factors of repurchase behavior of consumers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) model and analyzes how their effects differ among mobile channels and the online channel. The mobile channels are divided into three channels: mobile application ("app"), mobile browser, and mobile shopping portal channels. Real purchase data for three million orders from online shopping sites is used for our empirical analysis. The results show that all RFM variables significantly affect repurchase behavior. Our findings imply that mobile app users are more likely to repurchase than users in other channels. It is also found that the frequency variable is more important for mobile channel users, while the recency variable is more important for online channel users.

Thus, this study strived to explore the dissimilar use of product information cues in product evaluations of online shopping sites. We conducted different experiments with three product cues: country of origin, ranking, and sales. In addition, an electrophysiological monitoring method was used to measure neurophysiological states while customers assess the diagnosticity of cue usage in decision making. The valid data collected from 160 customers provide strong support that different extrinsic cues can stimulate different emotional responses at specific sites. The insights from the findings can benefit designers and marketers in implementing more effective marketing strategies.

The research model was developed by utilizing cognitive psychology, affective psychology, as well as on literatures marketing field to answer the research question, what cognitive factors can explain IT users’ satisfaction? To answer the question, the current study analyzed online reviews by using CAINES (Content Analyzer and Information Extraction System). CAINES is designed to analyze unstructured online documents by using syntactic and semantic techniques. Our pilot empirical test using a sample of 763 online reviews about smart phones offers preliminary support for this model. We found that payment equity and affect were significantly related to user satisfaction. But the relationship between disconfirmation and satisfaction were not significantly identified.

%X This study explores online customer search behavior on a large e-commerce website—Walmart.com. In order to more accurately predict customer purchase conversion based on their search behavior, we adopt a modern machine-learning technique, random forest, as well as logistic regression to develop two computational models.  We also integrate information retrieval literature to propose metrics to quantify online consumers’ search behavior.  Results show that the random forest model performs better with a very high accuracy rate (76%) in predicting customers who will purchase the item they browsed. Among all the predictors, page and session dwell time, user type, click entropy, and click position are the strongest influential factors for the conversion behavior. The findings suggest that, with the enhanced metrics and modeling approaches, search behavior could offer strong cues about customers’ purchasing decision.  Additionally, the findings also suggest operational implications about how to accommodate and induce the desired search behavior with the e-commerce website.

%X E-commerce adoption has been extensive but for some specialized areas it is still in the early stages. One such area is health-related websites where the sensitive issues around the consumer’s health ex-tenuate the similar challenges faced in other areas of e-commerce. Disclosing personal information is necessary to fully utilize such health-related websites but consumer trust is required for this. This re-search proposes a model of the role of trust in personal information disclosure on health-related web-sites. This model identifies 10 factors grouped in three categories. The first category is dispositional factors including faith in humanity, trusting stance and privacy concern. the second category is situational factors including reputation and perceived risk. Lastly the third category is institutional factors including the perceived effectiveness of the privacy statement, third party certification, legal and regulation and security infrastructure. Low risk, reputation, effective privacy statement and privacy seals were found to facilitate trust. While institutional factors like the legal framework and regulation have an elevated role to keep the consumer safe in this context, lack of clarity on what they are leads to a weak perception of their value. Trust in the health-related website was found to positively influence the intention to disclose information.

%X Online group shopping has emerged as a new e-commerce model and received attention in both academics and practice. Prior research focuses on investigating online group shopping mainly from the marketing discipline, and little research has tried to examine individual consumers’ acceptance of online group shopping from the technology acceptance perspectives. This paper aims at investigating the drivers determining individual consumers’ intention to use online group shopping as well as the relationships between the intention to use online group shopping and the intention to purchase via online group shopping websites. The research model was developed based on technology acceptance theories and extended to purchasing behaviour. The research model is empirically tested with data collected from 318 Chinese college students and analyzed using PLS. The results show that all the individuals’ intention to use online group shopping are motivated by relative advantages, perceived complexity and perceived enjoyment, and their use intention is significantly related to their purchasing intention via online group shopping websites. Finally, the limitations of the current research are discussed, and the directions for further research are suggested.

%X How to recognize the tendency of the coupons among the users who receive the coupons and then send the coupon reminder to improve the coupon redemption rate and reduce the marketing cost has become an important issue in the coupon decision-making process. Based on the log data and transaction data in enterprise database, this study combined with the demographics, past purchasing behavior, past coupon usage behavior and the visiting behavior during the coupon validity period to construct the e-coupon redemption behavior prediction model. The model is constructed to help e-commerce enterprises identify the target users who have the coupon proneness after the coupons are issued, so as to send coupon reminders in time and enhance the effectiveness of coupon marketing.

%X Augmented reality (AR) carries with itself a range of fascinating features which could be implemented by firms across different industry sectors to enhance user experience and add business value. The acceptance of AR can be viewed from two perspectives, viz. the acceptance by the user and acceptance by firms as a technology. However, the research gap observed is noteworthy. For an e-commerce firm, while there has been ample amount of research on acceptance of AR, there seem to be insufficient information on why augmented reality has not been adopted by these firms. In this research-in-progress paper, using the Technology, Organization and Environment using Tornatzky and Fleischer’s Technology-Organization-Environment model (TOE) as the guiding lens, we first theorize the factors significant for the acceptance of AR technology by e-commerce firms. Next, we intend to test the theorized relationships via a field survey of e-commerce firm personnel who are familiar with AR technology. Through this study, we will offer deeper understanding into the TOE framework for the adoption of AR technologies by e-commerce firms. Further, on the practical front, the study will help the e-commerce firms to strategize and focus on specific factors to implement augmented reality effectively.

%X Online consumer reviews have helped consumers to increase their knowledge about different products/services. While most previous studies try to provide general models that predict performance of online reviews, this study notes that different people look for different types of reviews. Hence, there is a need for developing a system that that is able to sort reviews differently for each user based on the ratings they previously assigned to other reviews. Using a design science approach, we address the above need by developing a recommender system that is able to predict the perceptions of each user regarding helpfulness of a specific review. In addition to addressing the sorting problem, this study also develops models that extract objective information from the text of online reviews including utilitarian cues, hedonic cues, product quality, service quality, price, and product comparison. Each of these characteristics may also be used for sorting and filtering online reviews.

%X The negative influence of consumer perceived product uncertainty on buying intention has long been found and studied by marketing researchers and practitioners. Identifying uncertainty mitigators hence has drawn extensive attention from traditional and digital market researchers. This study extends this line of study by exploring the effect of various e-commerce website facilities from a novel perspective – the communication theory view. Drawing on the Initial Interaction Theory (IIT) from communication literature, we view buyer-seller interactions as an initial communication process that aims to acquire information in order to reduce description uncertainty and performance uncertainty. In line with IIT, we propose a framework that incorporates perceived effectiveness of product descriptions, perceived media richness, and perceived effectiveness of feedback systems as the facilitators of passive, interac-tive, and active communication strategies in order to reduce product uncertainty. Research hypotheses are tested based on a survey of 325 subjects. Our findings confirm the saliency of these facilitators in mitigating buyer perceived uncertainty towards tourism products. Theoretical and practical implica-tions of the findings are discussed.

%X This research investigates early mover advantage of a special group of online firms: entrepreneurial etailers that operate on third party eCommerce platforms. The conventional wisdom suggests that early mover advantage would not be substantial when barrier to entry is low. However, this research argues that etailers, even when barrier to entry is low online, can enjoy early mover advantage because of the relatively high switching cost in the uncertain online environment, and the system design features of ecommerce platforms. Customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities, as measured by customer attraction, conversion and retention capabilities, can help enhance the sources of online early mover advantage. Panel data of 7,309 etailers from the cosmetics and women’s clothing industries is analyzed to verify the hypotheses. The empirical evidences strongly corroborate the predicted early mover advantage for online retailers and the role of CRM capabilities in boosting early mover advantage as well as etailer performance.

%X Cross-border e-commerce becomes more and more popular and general. The foci of researches in e-commerce have moved from domestic towards to global market. Yet, most of extant literatures are from buyer’s perspective, whereas sellers are also important in the success of cross-border e-commerce. In this study, we are aiming to identify the elements of the success of cross-border e-commerce and the relationship with trust and intention to use from seller’s perspective. To do so, we apply a mixed method to accomplish this research. We have identified the key factors which sellers are concerned about, and why they engage in cross-border e-commerce. In addition, we have developed new dimensions with associated items for system quality, service quality, perceived benefit and perceived cost in the context of cross-border e-commerce. The theoretical contributions and practical contributions have been discussed lastly.

%X Due to the increasing popularity of social media, social commerce has been emerging as a new form of e-commerce. As a driving force of the popularity and growth of social commerce, electronic wordof-mouth (eWOM) plays an important role during the process of consumers’ purchase decision making in social commerce. There are adequate studies that have offered a broad view on what makes the helpfulness perception of eWOM. However, little research has investigated the effect of argument strength and source dynamism of eWOM. Drawing on Stimulus–Organism–Response (S–O–R) model and Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), an integrated research model is proposed and tries to explore the impact of argument strength and source dynamism of eWOM on consumers’ affective response and cognitive response and how do they affect the formation of consumers’ purchasing intention. We expect that our study can make a contribution to theoretical development and provide some guidance for retailers to carry out a better management strategy of eWOM.

%X In the present competitive retailing environment, retailers are confronted with consumers who are prone to switch between online and physical retail channels as well as across retailers. This research attempts to understand the factors that influence multichannel consumer attitude to engage in switching. We propose a model based on the push-pull-mooring theory to study the impact of various determinants on attitude to switch between different multichannel retailers in the context of two types of products. Results suggest that exploratory consumer behavior has positive effects on switching attitude across both types of products. Further, there are numerous interesting findings that differ across search and experience products. We provide managerial insights for multichannel retailers and discuss the implications for future research on consumer switching behavior in a multichannel environment.

%X Innovations such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, and different forms of wireless Internet are transforming the nature of e-Commerce.  Traditional industries are being thrust into the Internet age as consumers force firms to adapt to their anywhere, anytime, any device (AWATAD) lifestyle.  This shift increasingly relies on digital platforms to act the intermediaries that enable businesses to reach their customers.  The current changes are dynamic and discontinuous as players from outside the traditional industry boundaries are changing the competitive landscape.  This paper analyzes data from executives in the telecommunications, information, media and entertainment (TIME) industries, a sector undergoing substantial change.  Using platform theory as an analytical lens, this paper applies Scenario Analysis to turn key uncertainties into illustrative futures that can guide managerial action.  This paper provides practical guidance to TIME executives and demonstrates how the Scenario Analysis method enables researchers to communicate theory-based insights to practitioners in a relevant way.

%X Privacy invasion, surveillance and profiling are some identified vulnerabilities as a consequence of trusting context-aware technologies such as smart-phones. With PC-enabled e-commerce transactions, the technological ecosystem was smaller with a corresponding simpler chain of trust. Context-aware technologies such as smart-phones are increasingly being used in initiating and completing commercial transactions. It is argued that newer and richer understanding of the issue of trust informed by mobile commerce is important. Research is needed to understand the nature of trust in context-aware technologies. This might lead on the one hand to valuable insights into the effect of the awareness of risks on user behavior and on the other hand, to suggestions on what can or should be done from the retailer or provider’s side to enhance the communication of risks and privacy issues to users.

%X It has been conjectured that the peer-based recommendations associated with electronic commerce lead to a redistribution of demand from popular products or "blockbusters" to less popular or "niche" products, and that electronic markets will therefore be characterized by a "long tail" of demand and revenue. We test this conjecture using the revenue distributions of books in over 200 distinct categories on Amazon.com and detailed daily snapshots of co-purchase recommendation networks in which the products of these categories are situated. We measure how much a product is influenced by its position in this hyperlinked network of recommendations using a variant of Google’s PageRank measure of centrality. We then associate the average influence of the network on each category with the inequality in the distribution of its demand and revenue, quantifying this inequality using the Gini coefficient derived from the category’s Lorenz curve. We establish that categories whose products are influenced more by the recommendation network have significantly flatter demand and revenue distributions, even after controlling for variation in average category demand, category size, and price differentials. Our empirical findings indicate that doubling the average network influence on a category is associated with an average increase of about 50 percent in the relative revenue for the least popular 20 percent of products, and with an average reduction of about 15 percent in the relative revenue for the most popular 20 percent of products. We also show that this effect is enhanced by higher assortative mixing and lower clustering in the network, and is greater in categories whose products are more evenly influenced by recommendations. The direction of these results persists over time, across both demand and revenue distributions, and across both daily and weekly demand aggregations. Our work illustrates how the microscopic economic data revealed by online networks can be used to define and answer new kinds of research questions, offers a fresh perspective on the influence of networked IT artifacts on business outcomes, and provides novel empirical evidence about the impact of visible recommendations on the long tail of electronic commerce.

%X This research aims at understanding the effect of long tail and trust on the customer motivation behind online shopping use. For this research, existing latest research framework Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2 (UTAUT2) is used for the basic 7 constructs of the UTAUT2 framework but two additional constructs “long tail effect” and “trust” are tested to understand whether these also influence the customer motivation to choose online channels for shopping. Research was conducted in Japan for two product categories i.e. airline ticket and book. One is a physical product while other is a service product. Both “long tail effect” and “trust” were found to have significant relationship with the intention to use, however there were some differences between the two products due to their inherent product characteristics. Inclusion of both “long tail effect” and “trust” constructs to the existing research framework is proposed in this research.

%X In this paper, we investigate the impact of reviewer attractiveness on perceived helpfulness of the online review. Extending the selective-accessibility model by generating the fitness hypothesis testing and integrating it with the original similarity hypothesis testing, we hypothesize that the review with an attractive reviewer’s consumption photo is perceived as more helpful than the average-looking reviewer’s. Besides, the effect is moderated by consumers’ appearance self-esteem (ASE). With two online experiments, we found that the review with an attractive reviewer’s consumption photo is equivalently helpful compared to the review with an average-looking reviewer’s. Moreover, the attractive reviewer’s review is perceived as less helpful if the consumers are low in ASE. These findings provide evidence against the conventional wisdom that “what is beautiful is good” and point out that at certain condition beauty might backfire. Our conclusions are highly relevant to online retailers, third party websites, and online merchants.

%X The Internet enables low-cost transaction-making via a variety of market mechanisms. It also facilitates the exchange of information between buyers and sellers more quickly without the limitations of time and space. Among the many new and innovative online business models, the online group buying model is an especially interesting one. Despite the enormous growth and significant impacts of group buying on Internet business marketplaces, little is known about the consumers’ motivations for participating in online group buying, the hierarchical structure of these motivations, and the hierarchical structure based segmentation.
%X Derived from the Uses and Gratifications (U&G) theory, this study aims to identify consumers’ motives behind their group buying behaviour, and build a hierarchical model of buying motives based on Means-end Chain (MEC) theory. According to the hierarchical structure of motives identified, the market will then be segmented. The results can provide a valuable insight into motivation theory by understanding the complexities underlying consumers’ motivational process that determines their online group buying behaviour. In addition, using U&G and MEC as theoretical frameworks, this study can not only provide in-depth insights into the major psychological and social drivers of group buying on the Internet, but also the concrete websites attributes which directly correspond with these motivations. By incorporating these lower levels attributes, group buying websites can attract more customers and survive in the competitive e-market.

This study provides additional information about the path from the service quality and trust to continuous usage. Also, this study investigates the different tendencies to continuance behavior by habit as a moderating effect within the conceptual model. According to the structural invariance test across moderating effect, it showed that: First, most of main effect paths showed significant positive signs only habit as moderator on trust in service provider is negative support. Second, the habit was supported as a moderator except for the trust in shopping-site to online shopping continuance interaction path. Unexpectedly, the positive moderating effect of habit tendency towards the path of trust in shopping-site to online shopping continuance in not significant. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

%X This study adopts four facets of visual aesthetics (i.e., simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, craftsmanship) to explain how they relate with users’ gaze patterns, based on how much they fixate on certain points, as well as how fast and how much distance their eyes cover. On a sample of 23 experienced users in online shopping, we collect eye-tracking data while looking at high, neutral, and low appealing websites, and then register their perceptions on visual aesthetics towards those websites. Findings show different patterns of gaze behavior related with users’ perceptions on visual aesthetics. Short fixations with high saccade show high simplicity, while high fixation variance and high backtrack shows high diversity. Short fixations with high backtrack show high colorfulness. Low saccade velocity with high skewness shows high craftsmanship. We contribute towards the need of automatizing the process of understanding users’ perceptions of visual aesthetics, as we might be able to predict the user behavior in real time in the future.

%X In this paper, we posit that consumer heterogeneity moderates the respective relationships between two important online purchase objectives of saving money and saving time on online purchase decisions. To explore this relationship, we empirically examine the moderating roles of consumer heterogeneity on the effects of money saved, time saved, and delivery time on purchase decisions. On the basis of analyses performed on data gleaned from an Internet-based survey, we demonstrate that the effects of saving money on preference for online purchase are more pronounced for consumers who are male, relatively young, and much discretionary time, while the effects of saving time are more pronounced for those who are male, younger, less discretionary time and relatively high income. In addition, the effect of delivery time on online purchase is amplified by disposable income, but attenuated by online shopping experience. Through our analyses, we also find that Japanese consumers value delivery time to a greater degree than Chinese and American consumers do.

%X The online marketplace has provided sellers an arena for marketing digital products and radically changing traditional distribution processes. Online sellers have also experimented with buyer-determined pricing schemes, such as the “Pay What You Want” model that is the focus of this study. Under this pricing scheme, buyers are allowed absolute control over the price of the transaction, including the amount of zero if desired. Using Social Exchange Theory as a guide, we explored the possibility that a buyer’s price he or she is willing to pay and the price actually paid for a digital product on the iTunes marketplace can differ based on social and economic factors associated with the transaction. While this study offers an exploratory look into the PWYW model in an online setting, the results provide insight for product developers and marketers considering this pricing scheme.

%X This study proposed a multichannel loyalty model aimed at integrating experience theory, schema theory and loyalty theory. Particularly, we built a multichannel retailer loyalty framework not only from the perspective of multichannel shopping behavior, but also from sequences of channel choices, namely shopping paths, including search online but purchase offline and search offline but purchase online. Correspondingly, this study segmented the framework into two specific models: Model1.search products in one multichannel retailer’s physical, and then purchase in the same multichannel retailer’s website (model 1:offline-online); Model2.search products in one multichannel retailer’s website, and then purchase in the same multichannel retailer’s physical store (model 2:online-offline).Besides, this study empirically tested the model by EFA and CFA with the use of Spss20 and Amos19 after developing the Structural Equation Model. As a result, we demonstrated that experience plays an important role on multichannel retailer loyalty through trust. Moreover, there exists experience spillover effect of channels. A significant interactive effect of trust on loyalty among channel has been supported.

In this research, we adopt the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2 (UTAUT2) and expand with two additional constructs “long tail effect” and “trust” to understand whether these two key factors influence the customer motivation to choose online channels for shopping. Research was conducted in Japan for two product categories i.e. airline ticket and book. One is a physical product while the other is a service product. Both “long tail effect” and “trust” were found to have significant relationships with the intention to use, however, there were some differences between the two products, due to their inherent characteristics. Inclusion of both “long tail effect” and “trust” constructs to the existing UTAUT2 research framework is proposed for future research.

%X Ubiquitous networking facilitates Internet access across multiple network environments, whose value is tied directly to user perceptions of its ability to securely execute transactions. Prior research has cited awareness, trust, and risk as critical determinants of adoption but has failed to examine these factors as they relate to infrastructure and its provider. Because information in transit is at risk from a network environment’s vulnerabilities, we focus on the implications of such risk on Internet activities. We examine the multiple parties that must be trusted to complete and facilitate an online transaction. We propose that the user must trust not only the information recipient to act benevolently but also the technologies and organizations that facilitate the online exchange.

%X Product ranking mechanism is an important service for e-commerce that facilitates consumers’ decision-making process. This paper studies online product ranking under uncertainty. Different from previous studies that generally rank products merely based on predicted ratings, a new personalized product ranking method is proposed based on estimating consumer information search benefits and taking prediction uncertainty and confidence into consideration. Experiments using real data of movie ratings illustrate that the proposed method is advantageous over traditional point estimation methods, thus may help enhance customers’ satisfaction with the decision-making process and choices through saving their time and efforts.

%X As online shopping proliferates, online product reviews (OPRs) play a crucial role in online consumers’ purchasing decisions. Although prior research on the effects of price changes on consumer reactions has provided insightful implications, little is known about the impact of price changes on the characteristics of OPRs. With the growing importance of OPRs as a key social recommendation system for potential consumers’ decision-making, it is important to understand the dynamics of OPRs around price changes. We select the Kindle 2 from Amazon.com as our focal product and conduct an exploratory case study. By analyzing 6,714 reviews on the Kindle 2, we examine how consumers respond to price decreases using OPRs. The results show that all four characteristics of OPRs (star-rating, review depth, positive emotion, and negative emotion) are significantly influenced by price decreases. Moreover, we found that the impacts of price decreases on OPRs’ characteristics are different between the first and the second attempts at price reduction. Interestingly, the number of reviews per day significantly soars immediately after the first price decrease, while there is no significant change in the number of reviews after the second price cut. We conclude the paper with a discussion of our findings.

%X Online shopping has become a common shopping channel. Consumers can freely choose their preferred shopping channels. However, will the public treat online and offline channel equally? Based on confirmation bias theory, the current study attempt to explore whether there is a prejudice toward online shopping and how prejudice influence consumers’ channel selection behavior. An explorative experiment was conducted with 124 subjects. The results indicate that prejudice toward online shopping does exist and significantly influence consumers channel selection behavior. Furthermore, the uncertainty of online shopping may induce consumer’s prejudice perception through confirmation bias and lead to both seller and product prejudice. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

%X An increasing range of services are now offered via online applications and e-commerce websites. However, problems with online services still occur at times, even for the best service providers due to the technical failures, informational failures, or lack of required website functionalities. Also, the widespread and increasing implementation of web services means that service failures are both more likely to occur, and more likely to have serious consequences. In this paper we first develop a digital service value chain framework based on existing service delivery models adapted for digital services. We then review current literature on service failure prevention, and provide a typology of technolo- gies and approaches that can be used to prevent failures of different types (functional, informational, system), that can occur at different stages in the web service delivery. This makes a contribution to theory by relating specific technologies and technological approaches to the point in the value chain framework where they will have the maximum impact. Our typology can also be used to guide the planning, justification and design of robust, reliable web services.

%X Drawing on trust transfer theory and signal theory, we investigate how perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) and perceived website quality of the seller (PWQS) moderate the relationships between trust in platform, trust in seller and purchase intention in the context of Consumer to Consumer (C2C) platforms. To test our proposed model, we surveyed 224 buyers of TaoBao, a major Chinese C2C portal. The results indicate that PEEIM has no effect on the relationship between trust in platform and trust in seller, yet it positively moderates the relationship between trust in seller and purchase intention. In addition, PWQS positively moderates the relationship between trust in platform and trust in seller, but negatively moderates the relationship between trust in seller and purchase intention. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

%X As a new transaction channel, the purchase feature in social media mobile apps enables consumers to pay merchant accounts directly. The convenience of mobile payment and the richness of product information and promotions may trigger more demand. The aim of this study is to quantify the effect of such a purchase feature on business sales revenue. Using transaction data from a large hotel chain company, we rely on variations in the timing of users enabling the purchase feature in the mobile app to identify the effect of adopting the mobile channel on hotel room reservation. To mitigate endogeneity caused by the nonrandom selection of being adopters and nonadopters, we apply the difference-in-differences approach with propensity score matched individuals. Our results show that adopting the purchase feature in mobile social media apps will significantly increase sales, and such increase is attributed to more transactions from social media channel.

%X Religion has long been playing a significant role in influencing human behavior. However, its business value as a predictor of buyer behavior has not been sufficiently examined in e-commerce context. The main contribution of this paper is to show the connection between the degree of religiosity and interpersonal trust (cognitive and affect-based trust) in Business to-Consumer (B2C) e-commerce. The study uses responses obtained from a convenient sample from Muslims and Christians in two different societies, Pakistan and Australia respectively. The data of the survey were analyzed using Partial Least Square (PLS) approach. The results indicate that interpersonal trust related to religiosity in a web-based retailer can vary with culture, at least as represented by affiliation to a religion. It is suggested that religiosity should be considered as possible determinant of trust in online shopping in the future.

%X The paper aims to optimize the final part of a firm’s value chain with regard to attended last-mile deliveries. It is assumed that to be profitable, ecommerce businesses need to maximize the overall value of fulfilled orders (rather than their number), while also limiting costs of delivery. To do so, it is essential to decide which delivery requests to accept and which time windows to offer to which consumers. This is especially relevant for attended deliveries, as delivery fees usually cannot fully compensate costs of delivery given tight delivery time windows. The literature review shows that existing order acceptance techniques often ignore either the order value or the expected costs of delivery. The paper presents an iterative solution approach: after calculating an approximate transport capacity based on forecasted expected delivery requests and a cost-minimizing routing, actual delivery requests are accepted or rejected aiming to maximize the overall value of orders given the computed transport capacity. With the final set of accepted requests, the routing solution is updated to minimize costs of delivery. The presented solution approach combines well-known methods from revenue management and time-dependent vehicle routing. In a computational study for a German metropolitan area, the potential and the limits of value-based demand fulfillment as well as its sensitivity regarding forecast accuracy and demand composition are investigated.

%X A notable change in consumer financial services over the past few years in China has been the growth of the use of Internet consumer credit. Internet-based consumption loan is the outcome of financial innovation and it allows individuals to shop online through the model of “buy now, pay later”. To explore factors affecting users’ intentions, this study applies trust theory and value anticipation to explain why people intend to use Internet consumer credit platform. According to existing online trust model, the factors in this study are categorized into three dimensions: personality-based, affect-based and platform-based. This study suggests that face wants, risk aversion, subjective norm, number of members, perceived authority, perceived privacy protection, perceived alternative cost, value anticipation and trust together provide a strong explanation for use intention in Internet credit consumption. The results of this research provided a theoretical foundation for future academic studies as well as practical guidance for rapid development of Internet consumer credit platform.

%X This study scrutinizes the predictive relationship between three referral channels, search engine, social medial, and third-party advertising, and online consumer search and purchase. The results derived from vector autoregressive models suggest that the three channels have differential predictive relationship with sale measures. Search engine plays a more important role in driving online sales, social media the next, and third-party ads the lowest. Referrals from social media, however, have the strongest relationship with conversion, search engine the next and third-party the lowest The predictive power of the three channels is also considerably different in referring customers among competing online shopping websites. This study offers new insights for IT and marketing practitioners in respect to better and deeper understanding on marketing attribution and how different channels perform in order to optimize the media mix and overall performance.

%X Analyses of users’ digital footprints and online search history can provide valuable behavioral information. Typically, online correlated searches for stock information can provide insights into revealing certain investor preferences and market phenomenon. Prior research primarily focuses on mature stock markets such as those in the U.S. markets. The emerging Chinese stock markets, which are characterized by unique investment features, are relatively unexplored. In this study, we explore the uniqueness of stock co-search networks in the Chinese context and investigate whether we can identify some interesting investment patterns such as return comovement where returns of stocks within the same search clusters tend to move in the same direction. Making use of network analysis, we construct search clusters from co-search data obtained from Sina Finance. We find some interesting behavioral patterns from online correlated searches. The empirical results provide evidence on the existence of within-cluster return comovement as well as a cluster-level factor that moderates return comovement in the context of the Chinese stock markets. This research is of practical relevance for investors in an investment decision-making scenario. It also contributes to Information Systems (IS) research in applying online correlated searches to revealing behavioral outcomes (i.e. return comovement) in an emerging market.

%X We conducted a randomized field experiment in collaboration with a large e-commerce platform in the US to examine the impact of social media integration (in the form of a Facebook comment system) on users' shopping behaviors (e.g., adding a product to cart, placing an order). Our results show that implementing a Facebook comment system leads to significantly increases in customers' likelihood of adding a product to cart (~6% increase) and placing an order (~10% increase). Further analyses on the heterogeneous treatment effects show evidence of social learning mechanism: the effect of a Facebook comment system on customer conversion is positive with many comments, yet is negative with few comments. Also, the positive effect of a Facebook comment system on user conversion is stronger for new customers than repeat customers. Lastly, we performed difference-in-difference (DID) analysis and found that Facebook comment system increases the demand for all products in the experiment.

%X Today, several social commerce features exist, which can be integrated into e-commerce websites. Integrating such features facilitates interactions among consumers and shall positively affect the perception of social factors and the buying behavior. As social commerce features differ regarding the stimulated interactions, it is recommended to increase their effectiveness by using multiple features. However, there also exist warnings that introducing multiple features might overwhelm consumers. To study the effects of the intensity of social commerce features on the perception of social factors and the buying behavior, we present the results of a controlled experiment, in which 115 participants used variants of an e-commerce platform with differing sets of features. The findings indicate that the intensity of features might positively influence the perception of social factors and the buying behavior. The provided research model moreover allows examining the causal relations between social commerce features, social factors, and the buying behavior systematically.

%X This paper explores the mobile payment phenomenon from SME perspectives in the Kenyan retail sec-tor. Following a qualitative approach, and in-depth interviews, the study concludes that the contextual challenges of Kenya have rendered other forms of mobile payment such as making contactless pay-ments, unknown. However, when other mobile payment options were made known, there was strong support for proximity mobile payments. The findings show that the introduction of any alternative mo-bile payment option in the Kenyan context would be a challenge against the stable trusted way of con-ducting mobile payments. It is recommended that strategies for building trust and customer awareness and adoption of alternative payment methods; be prerequisite towards new and alternative mobile payment options by retailers. The findings show how mobile payments, such as Lipa na MPesa have become institutionalised in the Kenyan SME structures; and how SMES themselves mobilize to legitimize mobile payments. Addition-al results show that Kenyan retailers are strongly driven by customer’s attitude, perception and will-ingness to adopt new payment methods. They identify mobile network reliability as a challenge and indicated that degradation in service levels resulted in a bad customer experience as it led to confu-sion of a transactions success.

%X Organizations need to maintain enduring and stable organizational identity to gain long-term success while  must  adapt  quickly  to  the  increasingly  volatile  environment  as  a  critical  condition  for profitability  and  survival.  Such  ongoing  paradoxical  challenge  concerning  management  of organizational  identity  has  been  left  unaddressed  in  the  existing  literature.  Drawing  on  the ambidexterity and organizational identity literatures, this paper proposes two theoretical frameworks to  systematically  examine  how  organizations  especially  in  the  e-commerce  industry  should  manage their  organizational  identities  by  leveraging  on  four  types  of  balancing  modes  of  ambidexterity.  The case of Damai, which is China’s No.1 online ticket seller, was comprehensively analyzed on the basis of  these  two  models.  Our  study  not  only  contributes  to  knowledge  of  organizational  identity  and ambidexterity but also provides detailed means for practitioners to manage organizational identities at both strategic and operational levels.

%X Recently, there are two mainly methods for SMEs operating cross-border e-commerce in China. One is online store of firms via the cross-border third party platform. The other is the online store of firms built by themselves for export markets expansion. Based on the analysis of cross-border e-commerce process, we explore four factors which may affect the mode selection of cross-border e-commerce of SMEs, namely E-marketing, electronic payment, electronic customs and international logistics. For the methodology, we use Probit model of Logit modeling and then have the finding that the three factors E-marketing, electronic customs and international logistics are the impact of SMEs cross-border e-commerce mode selection, and further find that most of SMEs who are weak at cross-border e-commerce operation stay on third party cross-border e-commerce service platform. Based on the finding, we also have some conclusion. In order to assist SMEs development, the government should establish and improve the trade informational platform. Meanwhile, they should encourage the cross-border e-commerce third-party platform to become bigger and stronger and improve electronic customs clearance continuously to raise large scale cross-border logistic firms and third parties with good service, strong competition and high technologies. For the SMEs, they should adopt the third party cross-border e-commerce platform actively. Some firms should have their own cross-border websites for opening cross-border e-commerce channel actively.

%X Consumer perceptions of risk and their trust beliefs are considered amongst the most important psychological states influencing online behavior. Despite the number of empirical studies that have explored the effects of trust and risk perceptions on consumer acceptance of e-services, the field remains fragmented and the posited research models are contradictory. To address this problem, we examined how trust and risk influence consumer acceptance of e-service through a meta-analysis of 52 studies followed by tests of competing causal models. The findings confirm that trust and risk are important to e-service acceptance but trust has a stronger effect size. We found that certain effect sizes were moderated by such factors as the consumer population under study, the type of e-service, and the object of trust under consideration. The data best supports the causal logic that positions trust as antecedent to risk perceptions. Risk partially mediates the effects of trust on acceptance.

%X The rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets has been fueling the growth of mobile commerce around the world. This paper quantifies the economic impact of tablets in ecommerce markets by examining its complementary and substitution effects with PCs and smartphones. We use an archival data from the largest ecommerce website in China and exploit a quasi-natural experiment to identify our results. Results show that the introduction of tablets enhanced the overall growth of ecommerce markets, with an annual impact of approximately US$3.04 billion. The tablet channel acts as a substitute for the PC and a complement for the smartphone. Further, consumers spend more when a tablet is simultaneously used with a PC, a smartphone, or both. The most revenue generating combination of simultaneous device usage is that of a smartphone and a tablet. We provide insights for retailers about how to increase their sales revenue in the emerging tablet economy.

The results reveal that the sentiments of posts related to e-commerce company news (i.e., objective posts) are negatively related to product return rate. On the contrary, the sentiments of social network posts related to product use, purchase and service experiences (i.e., subjective posts) are positively related to product return rate at a focal e-commerce website. The paper contributes to product return research as well as social network prediction research. Practitioners may use the method to predict product return rates using social network posts.

%X This research investigates product presentation mode influence on the process and outcomes of online shopping. The growth of online shopping brings with it cognitive challenges for consumers attempting to assess large numbers of options in purchase decisions. Further, there is little guidance for vendors in terms of presenting large numbers of product options to aid consumer decision processing and the shopping experience. In this study, online shopping is viewed as an information processing, decision task. This approach is ameliorated by looking at the experiential aspects of shopping online. Flow, the theory of optimal experience, is introduced as a lens to study experiential aspects in online shopping scenarios. This study provides guidelines to vendors for supporting consumer shopping processes and optimising consumer experience in online shops. Evidence is presented to indicate that optimising the consumer experience during their shopping trip may be of greater importance for vendors than supporting better decision processing. The findings relating to online shopper flow experience are more substantial than those relating to consumer decision behaviour, though both hold significance. Ultimately, the study shows that online shopping experiences may be influenced through the careful design of presentation modes. In our study, consumer experiences online influenced behavioural intentions to a large degree. As such, affecting the online consumer experience is a fruitful avenue for research and has important implications for online vendors.

%X As an emerging e-commerce business model, social commerce distinguishes itself through leveraging social media in affecting customer’s purchase decision making. However, in the context of social commerce, the specific mechanism between social media and customer satisfaction, as an important intangible and leading measure of business success, has not yet been fully understood. Based on social capital theory, we develop a model that explains how social media enhance customer satisfaction by facilitating three facets of social capital attainment, i.e. social interaction ties, shared language, and trust, through social presence and interactivity. The social capital would encourage social interaction and collaboration among consumers to exchange domain knowledge and experience, which lead to informed and accurate purchase decision and overall satisfaction lift. This study could provide a new theoretical lens for social media and customer satisfaction research as well as implications for social commerce platform designing and operating.

%X Classical economical theories assume whatever information is available about products will be fully and efficiently processed by consumers, thus the increase of information amount would lead to greater diversity of decisions. However, consumers’ information processing capacity is limited. A large amount of product alternatives that requests consumers’ intensive cognitive effort will activate their social learning by switching decision strategy and relying on the information of product popularity. Thus, this experimental study attempts to discover the mixture of consumers’ rationality and sociality in online shopping. A 2*2 factorial design was conducted to tease out the effects of choice set and product popularity on individuals’ cognitive efforts and preference reversal, as well as the effects on the market structures that are aggregated from individual decisions. The experimental results demonstrate that, despite a large amount of product alternatives, participants may not always invest abundant cognitive efforts and the market is more concentrated with the presence of product popularity. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Despite all digitally-enabled opportunities to regain competitive power, LOOROs still hesitate to adopt digital tools and applications. Politicians, city managers and retail lobbies seek for triggers to support the local structures and to push the digitalization efforts of local retailers. Building on AndreoniÂ´s "Carrot-and-Stick Approach", this study examines the impact of the availability of resources (carrot) and the perception of pressure (stick) on the use of digital applications among 223 owners of LOOROs from 26 cities in Germany. Our findings show that LOOROs are receptive for "Carrot-and-Stick". LOOROs seek for orientation while suffering under a shortage of time and capacities and seem to be disconnected from the development of their competi-tors and their customers.

%X The development of cross-border e-commerce highlights the importance of service integration and information sharing. This paper considers a cross-border B2B supply chain which consists of a local manufacturer and a foreign trade service integrator. The service integrator holds the service cost structure as private information. The optimal decisions and maximum expected profits of the manufacturer and service integrator are analyzed under two scenarios：no information sharing versus information sharing. The paper finds that information sharing always benefit the manufacturer but not for the service integrator. In the meanwhile, the value of information is increased with the manufacturer’s forecast uncertainty about the service integrator’s service cost. The whole supply chain can get pareto improvement through the Nash bargaining mechanism.

%X Recommender systems are frequently used as part of online shops to help consumers browse through large product offerings by recommending those products which are the most relevant for them. Although consumers’ interactions with recommender systems have been subject to substantial research, it is still unclear what the effect on aggregated sales diversity is, i.e. whether this leads to predominance of fast-selling or niche products. It is also unclear, whether any potential effects would differ between specific recommender technologies. We created a realistic web-experiment to monitor consumer behavior while purchasing digital music tracks when different recommender technologies are present. To analyze potential changes in sales diversity we used the Gini coefficient as well as additional measures. We found that sales diversity increases for all recommender technologies, except for bestseller lists. Furthermore, the differences across recommender technologies are rather small. Our findings have significant implications for online retailers and for producers.

%X Using a database of 11,001 unique sponsored search keywords, we investigate the relationship between the characteristics of keywords oriented around deal-seeking and brand-seeking and consumer search behaviors and buying propensities. On the basis of the search depth versus search breadth framework, we hypothesize that deal-seeking keywords elicit a search of greater breadth, whereas brand-seeking keywords induce a search of greater depth. We also explore the moderating effect of product type (search or experience goods) on the relationship between keyword characteristics and consumer search behaviors and how high-demand seasons (e.g., scheduled sales) influence consumers’ search and purchase behaviors. In addition, we estimate the effectiveness of keywords on the basis of their sales-per-cost performance. The findings indicate that search queries containing deal-seeking keywords are associated with higher click-through rates and conversion rates than are search queries without such keywords. We also find that the positive effect of deal-seeking keywords on click-through rates is more pronounced for experience goods than for search goods. However, we identify a negative interaction between experience goods and brand-seeking keywords. A comparison of deal-seeking and brand-seeking keywords in terms of cost effectiveness reveals that deal-seeking keywords generate approximately three times the sales of those produced by brand-seeking keywords.

%X The portability of a mobile device and the ubiquity of mobile Internet provide e-market users with more opportunities of access to e-commerce sites throughout a day. In this paper, we examine the access affordance of mobile technologies by analyzing the changes in purchase time dispersion of e-marketplace users after their adoption of mobile channel. By analyzing a large archival dataset including transactions in the mobile and online channels, we find that (1) a user’s purchase time becomes more dispersed throughout a day after the mobile channel adoption, and (2) the impact of the mobile channel adoption on the purchase time dispersion is significantly different across different user groups. These findings present strong empirical evidences of access affordance of the mobile channel and how the affordance is realized across e-market users.

%X Media companies and retailers make increasing efforts to integrate content-oriented and commerce-oriented business models online. This has led to the emergence of a new type of business model called content-driven commerce, which has yet to be examined in any depth. In this study, we adopt a phenomenon-based approach and investigate how both media companies and retailers implement content-driven commerce. Using the business model concept as a framework, we conduct a dual case study on an outdoor retailer and a gardening magazine, both of which offer products as well as content online. Our results indicate that the value proposition and the customer relationships of the companies’ online business models are similar, whereas their organizational infrastructure and revenue model differ. When pursuing content-driven commerce, media companies have to ensure not to harm their credibility, while retailers have to overcome the problem of free riding.

%X Online referrals have become an important mechanism in leveraging consumers’ social networks to spread firms’ promotional campaigns and thus attract new customers. However, despite a robust understanding of the benefits and drivers of consumer referrals, only minimal attention has been paid towards the potential of classical promotional tactics in influencing referral behavior. Therefore, this study examines scarcity and social proof, two promotional cues which are linked to extant referral literature and are of great practical relevance, in the context of a randomized online experiment with the German startup Blinkist. Our analysis reveals that scarcity cues affect consumers' referral propensity regardless of the presence of social proof cues, but that social proof cues amplify scarcity’s effect on consumer referral propensity. We demonstrate that consumers’ perceptions of offer value drive the impact of scarcity on referral likelihood and illuminate how social proof moderates this mediating effect.

Using a data-driven topic model, this study plans to investigate the semantic differences in online product reviews posted by consumers from China and the United Sates. The preliminary results from a pilot study of online reviews of books show that Chinese reviewers focus more on a product’s concrete attributes while American reviewers prefer to express their general evaluations of the product.

%X Traditional economic and business forecasting about corporate credit has relied on statistics from government agencies, annual reports and financial statements. These statistics are often published with significant delay, which limits their usefulness for predicting changes in creditworthiness.  Yet, a delay in responding to changes in a company’s credit rating can have significant financial and risk consequences.  With the widespread adoption of search engines, social media and related information technologies, it is possible to obtain data on literally trillions of economic decisions almost the instant that they are made. In this study, we investigated the power of these online activity data combined with data on firms’ business ecosystem to predict the likelihood of counterparty credit downgrade risk. The research offers a novel approach that contributes to the fields of information systems, finance, and social science by providing new insights on the role of these data types on firms’ financial risk.

%X Increased propensity of consumers directly visiting the e-commerce website is the most prominent effect of display advertising. Therefore, understanding consumers’ directed revisit behaviors is important for advertisers to arrange their advertising delivering activity. In this paper, authors used an e-commerce website’s consumers browsing data and advertising clicking data to examine the relationship between consumers’ previous shopping behaviors and their direct revisit. Besides, they also consider the visit channels (i.e., direct visit, generic advertising, and retargeting advertising). The results show that for consumers entering the website through different channels, their previous behaviors have different effect on the probability of revising directly in the future. The findings extend previous direct visit studies and can help website to advertise.

%X Cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) has become an important channel to help a firm to go into the international market in China. The recent influx in development of CEBC has caused a simultaneous influx in accumulation of text data such as consumer feedback. To better understand consumer feedback, we collected data from a leading CBEC firm in China to explore the topics of feedback posted directly by their customers. We employed the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to explore the potential topics focused on most by consumers. We found 35 primary topics are mentioned by both sellers and buyers. For the seller’s perspective, we found that the topics such as commission, product audit, communication between seller and buyer, order management and traffic are most important. On the buyer’s side, we found that return and refund, product tracking, product description, shipping time, and seller performance are the most mentioned topics. This study will help contribute to the understanding of how consumer feedback will help firms in many ways, including but not limited to recovering service and product failures, audit internal functions, and improve product quality.

%X Cloud service certifications (CSCs) are proposed in practice as instruments to mitigate the prevailing uncertainties about cloud computing, but research on their efficacy in business contexts thus far is lacking. In addition, previous research on other types of IT certifications is consumer-focused and inconclusive in terms of certifications´ effects on factors that influnce decisions, resulting in a vast literature body on certifications´ outcomes that lacks structure. To address these research needs, we first derive a conceptual model of certifications´ outcomes based on a systematic literature analysis of 42 empirical studies. Next, informed by the conceptual model, we explore outcomes of CSCs and related contingency factors through seven interviews with cloud computing experts. We find that cloud service certifications influnce decisions directly and indirectly via perceived assurance, perceived risks and trust. Moreover, these outcomes are moderated by contingency factors, such as trust in the certification and cloud experience. Our study contributes to research by structuring the variety of concepts in literature on certifications´ outcomes and serving as a knowledge base for future research. Furthermore, it contributes to practice by helping practitioners to understand CSCs´ outcomes and contingency factors.

%X This study compares the effectiveness of product- and category-specific advertising personalization in Social Retargeting. Social Retargeting combines the features of social advertising, targeting consumers based on social connections, and retargeting, using consumers’ browsing behavior to personalize ad content. We conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment in collaboration with a major e-retailer. Contradicting prior empirical findings, our results indicate that product-specific ads outperform less personalized category-specific ads. While theory suggests a positive effect, we find that social targeting decreases the performance of personalized ads. Surprisingly, socially targeted consumers are not more responsive to product-specific ads. We show that our results remain robust and are driven by ad personalization when controlling for temporal targeting and how deep consumers browse the e-retailer’s website. Our study contributes to the IS and marketing literature related to personalization in digital advertising and provides valuable suggestions for firms’ personalization strategies.

%X Online trading interfaces are important instruments for retail investors. For sound reasons, regulators obligate online brokers to inform customers about certain trade related risks. Research has shown that different behavioral biases can decrease traders’ performance and hence lead to pecuniary losses. The disposition to hold losing stocks too long and sell winning stocks too early (‘disposition effect’) is such a deviation from rational behavior. The disposition effect is analyzed for the prediction market ‘Kurspiloten’ which predicts selected stock prices and counts nearly 2000 active traders and more than 200,000 orders. We show that the disposition effect can be aggravated by visual feedback on a trader’s performance via colored trend direction arrows and percentages. However, we find no evidence that such an interface modification leads to higher activity. Furthermore, we can not confirm that creating awareness of the disposition effect with textual information is suited to decreasing its strength.

%X Following the increasing popularity of social commerce sites, this study investigates the information sources and forms that affect consumers in their decision-making process. Building on the theoretical underpinnings of uses and gratifications and dual-process theories, we distinguish between marketer and user generated content, and differentiate formats into informational and normative. Using an eye-tracking approach on a popular social commerce site with a sample of 23 participants, we find significant differences in the types and format of information consumed for selected versus eliminated products. Specifically, we looked at engagement, cognitive processing, and observation of consumers, since they reveal information about the mental and processing mechanisms during decision making. We find that consumers present a number of differences in terms of these measures among the different types of content, and with respect to selected versus eliminated products. We conclude the paper summarizing the findings and drawing theoretical and practical implications.

The goal is to investigate contributing factors affecting cloud computing adoption of e-commerce in developing countries, in particular its implication for Indonesia. Ten themes have been identified: business size and type, customer service improvement, security, economic value, infrastructure, business process improvement, cloud computing framework, regulatory framework, user acceptance, and stakeholders’ support. Among these ten themes, the infrastructure, security, stakeholders’ support, regulatory framework, user acceptance and business size/types themes are particularly relevant to Indonesia. The paper also presents efforts and projects that are currently in place, at the governmental level, that facilitates cloud computing adoption and e-commerce in Indonesia.

%X Recommender systems aim to support users in identifying the most relevant items. However, there are concerns that recommenders may imprison users in a “filter bubble” by recommending items predominantly known to them. On the other hand, providing unconventional items may increase risks of not meeting users’ taste. Given this trade-off, we analyze the effects of consumers’ perceived levels of recommendation novelty and serendipity on perceived preference fit and enjoyment. We find that merely increasing the level of novel recommendations is disadvantageous. Instead, recommenders should provide more serendipitous recommendations as this leads to higher perceived preference fit and enjoyment. In addition, market and recommender technology characteristics must be taken into account, since they partially determine the level of novel and serendipitous recommendations. Our findings have significant implications for research as they add additional insights on users’ evaluations of recommender systems. For practice, our results support online retailers in developing better recommenders.

%X Researchers in many diverse areas have consistently found that we are unduly influenced by negative information. In electronic commerce, this negativity bias is evident in the effect of product reviews on consumer behavior in the information systems literature. While the negativity bias is well documented, there has been little systematic and empirical research on its underlying causes. Utilizing a novel data set collected from Apple’s App Store, we examine three probable causes of the negativity bias: that negative reviews are more specific, that they have higher surprise value, and that they increase our ability to avoid losses. The empirical analysis revealed that while all three mechanisms contribute to the negativity bias, the ‘surprise’ factor and the ability to avoid losses play a more prominent role when consumers process and integrate positive and negative review information. Our findings also carry important practical implications for review platforms and online companies.

%X Assurance mechanisms are an important element of relational governance and frequently used in information systems (IS) research; still missing in this field, however, is a coherent and interrelated structure to organize available knowledge. In this study, we provide a first step towards development of a conceptualization framework of relational assurance mechanisms to enable their further investigation. From our analysis of existing literature, we discover two gaps in assurance research: (1) a fragmentation of assurance research and (2) a lack of conceptual consensus on relational assurance mechanisms. We provide a theoretical framework consisting of a conceptualization of identified relational assurance mechanisms, their antecedents and effects as a means of advancing theory in this area. Several possibilities for future research are discussed.

%X We focus on how two numeric characteristics of prior usersâ€™ votes influence userâ€™s attitude towards the product/service reviewed. These characteristics are 1) vote ratio and 2) vote magnitude. The former is the ratio of prior viewers who believe that a review is helpful, and the latter is the total number of prior viewers who vote the review. We draw on social influence theory and propose vote ratio influential across positive and negative reviews but vote magnitude influential only for negative reviews. We conduct two experiments to test the research model. Our research finds that regardless of the valence of reviews, vote ratio enhances trustworthiness and guide corresponding product evaluation. By contrast, vote magnitude is significantly influential only for the negative review. These findings contribute to review helpfulness literature and extend social influence theory. Our research also provides practical implications for online voting system providers, general participatory sites, and online retailers.

%X Social shopping (s-shopping), a novel online shopping model which connects consumers and leverages collaborative efforts, has achieved initial success. However, the continued usage remains a serious issue. To explore the consumers’ intentions to continually participate in s-shopping activities, we reviewed literature on sustaining IS usage and s-shopping technical designs and built a research model. To test the hypotheses, an online survey of s-shopping users was conducted in a leading Chinese social network site, Sina Weibo. The results confirmed that consumers’ perceptions of the usefulness and enjoyment of using the s-shopping system are critical predictors of their persistent usage. Moreover, informational social support from the virtual group also encourages ongoing participation in the collaborative shopping activities. In addition, personalization, social interaction and social presence support of the s-shopping system are discovered as remarkable antecedents of consumers’ usefulness, enjoyment and social support perceptions of the system. This paper fills in the research gap of s-shopping continuance and enriches s-shopping literature.

However, today's IT context is characterized by the proliferation of big data, business intelligence and predictive analytics projects often incubated in business units but that require IT's commitment for effective deployment. For CIO's, the IT governance approaches of the past need to be augmented with new methods, exemplars and reference models. We discuss three pillars to IT governance for this new era: a general model of big data and analytical solution deployment, a summary of current industry best practices and a taxonomy of plan, design and execution imperatives. These pillars provide foundation for an Analytics Capability Reference Model that has been validated in industry settings.

%X Nowadays, people communicate with many others online. Of the online sites, product review pages have become an important communication medium on which consumers share information about a product. Drawing upon this trend, we examined the factors that affect reviewers’ self-disclosure behavior. Prior studies have found that privacy behaviors such as self-disclosure are affected by diverse contextual factors. In this study, we propose that online crowdedness is an important contextual factor for self-disclosure behavior. Using review data from the largest online apparel rental site in the U.S., we empirically explored the relationship between online crowdedness and self-disclosure behavior. The result shows that online crowdedness can discourage self-disclosure behavior.

%X Determinants of consumer’s shopping behavior are of long-term interest to researchers. Since product photos directly aid consumers’ understanding of products, retailers often put a lot of effort into polishing them. However, there is limited research on the impact of product photos on shopping behavior. This research takes advantage of image-processing techniques to study product photos’ impact. These techniques allow us to investigate a large set of photo characteristics simultaneously in an empirical study. To rule out possible confounding factors, we use a real company dataset from a social shopping Website, which has a simple interface allowing consumers to judge products mainly based on their photos. We employ two-stage nested logit model embedded with differences-in-differences approach and examine product photo characteristics from the aspects of color, composition, complexity, and model face. We found that consumers prefer to click product photos with a warmer color, a larger key object, appropriate complexity.

%X Cloud Computing (CC) is a computing paradigm that besides its positive outlook is also associated with risks and uncertainties. As a consequence, trust in CC providers is an important antecedent for CC adoption. Trust is a perception which is shaped by communication. From the perspective of CC providers, websites are a convenient way for contacting potential clients. Literature suggests applying trust-inducing features to websites in order to raise CC providers’ trustworthiness. These trust-inducing features are classified into three website design dimensions, namely visual, social cue and content design. The goal of our study is to analyze whether leading CC Providers make use of these design recommendations. We find that some website features are used by all CC providers while other website elements are used less frequently. Consequently, there is a need to investigate why certain website elements have not been adapted by CC providers. Moreover, there are differences in how providers embed trust-critical information such as technical information, or storage locations. By getting an impression about how cloud providers in practice design their websites with regard to trust this article may stimulate the discussion and further research on how trust can be created by CC providers via their websites.

However, present methods in identifying variety seekers rely on qustionnaires and ignore that variety seeking may differ between product categories. In this paper, we present a model for measuring variety seeking behavior on a high level of granularity, based on a consumer´s purchases in individual product categories. Our study has three main contributions. Firstly, we contribute to the customer segmentation research stream by providing a novel way for identifying customers´ overall extent of variety seeking as well as their specific variety seeking at a category level. Second, for the most important retail categories we characterize the extent of variety seeking and provide a data-driven approach that is easy to operationalize by practitioners "“ especially for deploying large-scale personalized marketing measures in social or mobile commerce in physical stores. Finally, we provide a method to reconcile the highly granular category-level results with existing per person typologies.

%X Social commerce as a subset of e-commerce, popularizes rapidly with an increasing number of users, and consumers’ trust has become a crucial factor in the success of social commerce firms, and impacts on their decision on purchasing. In this regard, the study tries to research the characteristics of social commerce (transaction safety, concentration and enjoyment, communication and information quality) that influence consumers’ trust and assess the effects of trust on trust performance (purchase and word-of-mouth intentions), and trust performance will provides a basis for consumers to decide to purchase, and put forward feasible suggestions to social commerce firms. The results of an empirical analysis based on a sample of 133 users indicate that all the characteristics of social commerce involved had significant effects on trust, and then will positively influence trust performance.

%X Information technology (IT) has changed the dynamics of competition in the U.S. economy. Firms are gaining competitive advantage by competing on technology-enabled processes. For the retail industry, technology is breaking down the barriers between different retail channels and is making omnichannel retailing inevitable—an integrated sales experience that melds touch-and-feel information in the physical world with online content. Omnichannel retailing is becoming a trend and critical for retailers’ success. To keep up with the pace of change, existing retailers will need to create an omnichannel strategy and develop more omnichannel innovations. Based on the theories of the resource-based view (RBV), IT business value, and competitive dynamics, this study examines the factors that affect cross-channel capabilities and managerial actions in the U.S. apparel industry. We collected a longitudinal dataset on public apparel companies from 1995 to 2007. The empirical results reveal that both the quantity and scope of investments in enterprise IT applications were positively related to cross-channel capabilities. Financial resources positively moderated the relationship between enterprise IT applications and cross-channel capabilities. We found that enterprise IT applications increased the frequency and broadened the types of managerial actions. We found that cross-channel capabilities had mixed effects on managerial actions. Whereas market-oriented capabilities such as e-commerce and multi-channel cross-selling capabilities broadened the types of managerial actions, operation-oriented capabilities, such as cross-channel fulfillment, narrow the range of a firm’s managerial actions. Our findings provide important implications for managers in apparel and other retail sectors.

%X The advent of e-commerce puts traditional retail companies under a lot of pressure. A way retailers try to attract more customers to their physical stores is by offering online services on the retail sales floor. Such services are enabled through pervasive retail systems. These systems, however, do not only offer new opportunities but also bear risks for retailers because they heavily depend on privacy-related data, which customers could perceive as a potential privacy threat. In the present paper, we thus investigate the antecedents of customers’ usage intention towards such systems and the trade-off between the perceived benefits and the perceived privacy costs that are associated with their use. To this end, we propose a model based on the most recent version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the Extended Privacy Calculus Theory. We validate our model considering a smart fitting room application and show that the model is able to explain 67.1% of the variance in the behavioral intention to use the system and 43.1% of the variance in a person’s willingness to disclose private information. Our results can be leveraged to design pervasive systems that are perceived as valuable instead of privacy threatening.

%X Platform-based services are online services provided by e-marketplace operators to online sellers for them to compete and enhance performance. This paper aims at examining two important questions in the context of e-marketplace: (1) what kind of platform-based services can be used by online retail sellers as competitive moves? and (2) to what extent does the usage of these platform-based services impact online seller’s performance? Drawing on competitive dynamics theory, we argue that sellers that undertake a larger number of, more complex and heterogeneous platform-based services achieve better performance in e-marketplace. Using data of 1046 sellers, who open online retail stores and sell cosmetics on Taobao, a Chinese e-marketplace, we found that while undertaking more complex platform-based services is important by itself, it is more important to be strategic by undertaking a large number of platform-based services and these services had better be different from its competitors and the industry. Implications for  practice and research and suggestions for future research on improving sellers’ competitiveness are discussed.

%X In the recent decade, the short-term rental market is growing at a rapid rate. But some negative issues have followed. Trust has been regarded as one of the main impediments to the development of the short-term rental industry. In 2016, Xiaozhu.com encouraged hosts to present their Zhima Credit-a most popular third party online credit scoring in China- as a way to earn trust. We collect data of hosts in Shanghai and Beijing before and after they post Zhima Credit and conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to figure out whether reservations would be influenced by this action. According to our study, the entry of Zhima Credit does have a positive impact on the hosts’ reservations on Xiaozhu.com and the effect will last for quite a long time.

%X The explosive growth of user generated content presents a window of opportunity for online service providers (i.e., online review website) to utilize both forms of review information, namely numerical rating and opinionated review to facilitate trust building with users. Nevertheless, users’ trust in a website can be undermined by the irreconcilable dissonance between both forms of review information and their personality preferences. Consequently, it is important for websites to personalize the provision of numerical rating and opinionated review in order to convey trustworthiness to users through online consumer review. To empirically validate our research mode, we conducted a field study on a custom developed online review website with a sample of 170 college students. Results suggest that dissonance between numerical rating and opinionated review, as well as individuals’ preferences for self-reference and content relevance when processing online review information moderate the positive relationship between online consumer review and trust.

%X P2P lending is an innovation of micro-financial operation pattern, which is mainly used to meet the petty loan and investment demands of small and micro businesses and individuals. Given the rapid development of P2P market, there is a pressing need to understand lenders’ initial investment intentions in P2P platform. Although there are some studies exploring the factors explaining P2P lenders’ investment intentions, none of research has been reported from the perspective of the platform. This study extended technology acceptance model with perceived risk and initial trust as a theoretical framework to examine the roles of individual factors and platform factors in determining P2P lenders’ initial investment intentions. This study suggests that risk appetite, trust propensity, perceived ease of use, perceived security assurance, perceived privacy protection, perceived reputation, third-party certification, perceived risk and initial trust together provide a strong explanation for initial investment intention in P2P lending. The finding of this research provided a theoretical foundation for future academic studies as well as practical guidance for rapid development of P2P platform.

%X Crowdfunding is gaining much attention in theory and practice. Various platforms have emerged, offering different stakeholders the possibility to raise money from an undefined group of online users. Despite the growing interest, there appears to be little understanding of what drives backers to revoke pledged funds. In this research-in-progress paper, we address this issue by drawing on perceived risk theory. Perceived risk is widely recognized as the main source of negative influence on consumers’ purchasing behavior in e-commerce. Therefore, we aim at developing a theory ingrained research model that helps to analyze and understand the impact of perceived risks on backers’ funding on revocation behavior in reward-based crowdfunding. Doing so, our research contributes to the body of risk theory by applying it into a new context. It helps crowdfunding intermediaries and individuals to understand potentially occurring risks, and provides them with actionable advice on how to handle them.

%X The term Social Commerce (s-commerce) is used to describe an emerging trend where the seller and buyer are connected to the online social media networking. Customer loyalty is an important tool for developing future marketing business strategies in s-commerce field. Moreover, the effect of WOM on customer loyalty is also very important to the stability and sustainability of an s-commerce platform. While customer loyalty and WOM have been examined widely in different research contexts, the issue of customer loyalty in the context of s-commerce currently represents a gap in the literature. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the influence of WOM on customers’ loyalty to s-commerce websites. This research will gather survey data and applies structural equation modeling SEM to analyze the data. The findings will provide insights for s-commerce industries in developing strategies for improved implementation of s-commerce as well as the design of s-commerce sites.

%X The referral incentive programs are one of the common incentive mechanisms to attract new customers in e-commerce websites, especially for start-ups, by leveraging existing customer’s social networks. Designing an appropriate referral reward program will allow online businesses to increase customers base and enhance sales. This paper leverages the ultimatum game (sense of fairness) and construal level theory to investigate the impacts of social distance, social norm and market norm on the performance of different designs of referral reward programs. Lab experiments were conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. The results suggest that with close social distance, the success of an invitation is affected by the social norm between friends, but not monetary incentive; with far social distance, the success of an invitation is affected by division of referral bonuses. And a fair split of reward bonuses works best for friends with far social distance. The research sheds light on the appropriate design of incentives for different type of customers.

%X Numerous health websites are developing rapidly in China and the competition is fierce between these websites. In order to win the competition, the websites operators need to satisfy their customers to attain more market shares. But few attention has been paid to factors affecting customer satisfaction and loyalty on these websites. As a result, the paper aims to empirically  explore  the  factors  affecting  customer  satisfaction  and  loyalty  on  health  websites  based  on  perceived  service quality (responsiveness, empathy and reliability), perceived risk (financial risk and time risk) and trust, and then to propose some  targeted  measures.  A  survey  was  conducted  to  collect  data  by  means  of  questionnaires,  and  a  total  of  231  usable responses  were  gathered.  Then  the  hypothesis  model  was  tested  using  the  Structural  Equation  Modeling(SEM).  Results revealed  that  responsiveness,  empathy,  time  risk  and  trust  had  significant  impacts  on  customer  satisfaction,  whereas reliability  and  financial  risk  showed  no  effects  on  customer  satisfaction.  In  addition,  customer  satisfaction  and  trust significantly influenced customer loyalty. The implications and limitations were discussed .

%X It is well recognized that utilitarian and hedonic factors are both important in explaining customers’ consumption activities. Recent research has advocated the role of relational factors in affecting the adoption processes. However, no study has examined these three factors simultaneously in one study. We integrate the utilitarian and hedonic benefits of online shopping with the relational benefit by evaluating how they together contribute to user intention to return to a website. We also examine how these influence factors were moderated by website anxiety. The empirical results suggest that 1) perceived performance, enjoyment, and social presence increase customers’ intention, 2) website anxiety negatively moderates the relationship between perceived performance and intention, such that low website anxiety strengthens that relationship, and 3) website anxiety positively moderates the relationship between social presence and intention, such that high website anxiety strengthens that relationship. Implications for Web site designers and researchers are discussed.

%X Transaction costs in electronic business may become marginal, since negotiation processes can be assigned to software agents which act autonomously on behalf of their human principals. This advantage makes electronic negotiations highly appealing to actors in various e-business areas, including online auctions and product configuration negotiations. However, software agents can negotiate appropriately only if the preferences of their principals are explicitly available. While this task has been acknowledged as crucial challenge, it has only rarely been investigated how preferences of human principals can be extracted and modeled. This paper addresses this research gap by suggesting, implementing, and empirically testing a preference elicitation method that is based on fuzzy set theory and accounts for the impreciseness and subjectivity of preferences. Our findings indicate that the proposed method is suited for elicitating fuzzy set based preferences. Furthermore, the fuzzy preference model can project human decisions more accurately than a traditional, crisp approach.

%X The rapid development of cross-border e-commerce has injected new vitality and productivity to e-commerce. But it also brought the lag problem of cross-border logistics and distribution system. Under current models of logistics and distribution, the order cycle is too long to be efficient which coexist with high cost, uncontrollable risks and complicated procedure. These factors have hindered the development of cross-border e-commerce. In this case, the e-commerce overseas warehousing gradually come into being. How to overcome the contradiction of low-cost and fast delivery, take advantage of overseas warehouse building and successfully open up overseas markets, is an important issue needs to be discussed in the field of cross-border e-commerce. This paper talks from cross-border e-commerce and logistics distribution mode, discusses the rise of overseas warehouse building and analyze their strengths and weaknesses, then give a few suggestions to promote the construction and development of overseas warehouse.

%X Social commerce (SC) has become a new business mode for e-commerce along with the increased popularity of social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. Although SC has enormous business potential for practitioners and broadens research areas for scholars, existing studies on SC were limited. Little is known about the underlying processes and factors of consumers’ social sharing and social shopping behaviour in social commerce community (SCC). To fill the research gap, this study investigates the role of parasocial interaction (PSI) on consumers’ intention to engage in SC activities. An empirical research was conducted in Mogujie (www.mogujie.com), one of the most popular image-sharing SCCs in China, with a sample of 248 users. The results indicated that users’ PSI with other users significantly affects their social commerce intention (SCI). The task attraction and social attraction of SCCs positively affect PSI. However, the influence of physical attraction on PSI is insignificant. Moreover, social attraction is determined by the social-relevant features of SCCs (i.e., similarity, expertise, and likeability) and the task attraction is determined by task-relevant features of SCCs (i.e., information fit to task). The mood-relevant features of SCCs (i.e., visual appeal) positively affect physical attraction. This study has important implications for both information systems researchers and practitioners, especially for designers of SCCs.

%X From time to time, large numbers of researchers investigate the success factors of B2C e-commerce systems. However majority of those were conceptual studies. Though some empirically validated studies were published on B2C e-commerce systems, very few focused on Asian consumers. The study aims to fill this gap by studying ecommerce success factors among Asian online consumers. Another important objective of this study is to include factors such as perceived security, privacy, trust and perceived cost of transactions into the existing ecommerce success models.
%X Based on the IS success model proposed by DeLone and McLean and its further respecification and validation attempts made by other researchers later, a revised conceptual model is formulated. The model is tested and validated using the data collected from 240 Asian online consumers living in Thailand. The research generated 8 inter related dimensions of e-commerce system success which are information quality, system quality, service quality, trust, perceived sacrifice, perceived value, online customer satisfaction and repurchase intention. Results show that the user satisfaction and perceived value are the two important factors influencing the individuals to repurchase products and services from online portals. Online customer satisfaction is influenced by trust, perceived value, service quality, information quality and system quality. On the other hand, three quality dimensions as well as the perceived sacrifice construct influence perceived value. This study also proved that user‟s trust in the system is influenced by system quality and service quality of the e-commerce system.

%X Digital technologies are increasingly used for communication between service personnel and custom-ers. These digital service encounters bring along two changes: First, diverse digital channels such as text, audio, or video communication vary in the perceived media richness and perceived social presence of the counterpart. Second, digital channels allow service providers to employ service personnel remote from the customer and to serve a geographically wider, potentially global market. In this, there is a rise of intercultural service encounters. Therefore, we investigate how customer satisfaction is influenced by the type of digital communication channel and by cultural differences between service personnel and customer. We build a theoretical model on the effect of communication channels and cultural differences on customer satisfaction in digital service encounters. Afterwards, we collect data through an internet-based survey including a simulation of a digital service encounter and cultural differences. We use the data and structural equation modelling to test our theoretical model. Our results indicate that perceived media richness and perceived social presence play a substantial role for customer satisfaction. Contrary to prior literature on offline service encounters, our results suggest that perceived cultural distance does not affect customer satisfaction in digital service encounters.

%X  Consumer preference is a hot topic in the domain of marking management and e-commerce. Many previous studies have been conducted in this field. Whereas, there are rarely studies building on the particular commodity such as laptop. Therefore, this study explores comprehensive features that affect consumer preference for laptops by mining the online reviews. Firstly, we collect 6531 online reviews for Acer laptop from Amazon.cn and code these reviews with Nvivo10. Secondly, we develop a feature-based consumer preference model named MCPL based on the review text analysis. Considering the data imbalance of the collected 6531 product reviews, we adopt a random cluster sampling method to extract 50 groups with 100 samples per group. Then the correspondent regression analyses are conducted for the 50 groups of reviews. Finally, the meta-analysis is creatively conducted to integrate the multiple liner regression results of different groups. According to the result of meta-analysis, we demonstrate dominant features on behalf of the consumer preference of laptop and draw practical implications for enterprise competition strategies to facilitate product design or improvement.

%X Customers have over the years been used to buying products and services in shops or by ordering over the phone. By the end of the last century shopping over the Internet was added as a new important channel for commerce. As a result, it has become more and more important for organizations to attract customers and their site on the Internet; the interface is one part of this. In the discourse of marketing there is a field named servicescape and a related field named e-servicescape. For the providers of information systems the different views of service, servicescape and e-servicescape can be confusing. Hence it has to be considered   interesting if the intention is to build not only reliable and trustable systems but also information systems that are in accordance with what the e-servicescape user needs and demands. The question raised in this paper is whether there is a need for further research on the relation and connection between the terms servicescape and e-servicescape. To determine if e-servicescape is fully possible, plausible or not possible in comparison with servicescape the Conceptual model of servicescape by Harris and Ezeh (2008, p. 393) is used.

%X Over the last decade, bank industry has made a significant investment on mobile banking (MB) as an innovative tool with an expectation that MB services are being frequently used and increasing customer satisfaction. While the focus has been on increasing MB adoption, banking research shows more value is generated with frequent and continued usage of MB services, an area that has been given little attention. We develop a research model that integrates privacy and personalization with satisfaction and technology acceptance model (TAM) factors to address this gap. Using a sample of 486 MB customers from a US local bank, our regression results reveal that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are significant predictors of satisfaction, which leads to continued usage of MB. However, the interaction effects used in our model show statistical significance for privacy while not for personalization. Limitations and practical implications are discussed.

%X While there is a large body of research that studied trust in e-commerce, this study investigates causes and consequences of customer trust in online payment system within an Arab culture. The paper develops a theoretical model that exhibits the impact of five exogenous variables namely (internet experience, personal innovativeness, familiarity, propensity to trust, and presence of third party seal) on intention to use online payment via the mediation of three endogenous variables (perceived enjoyment, perceived risk and perceived trust). Data was collected via on online questionnaire (150) and paper-based questionnaire (200), and the analysis provides validation of the proposed model. Findings shed light on the role of customer trust and perceived enjoyment to mediate the effect of external variables (personal innovativeness, familiarity, propensity to trust, and presence of third party seal). This could assist in enhancing online payment websites acceptance by potential consumers in Arab countries.

%X As smartphones and tablets are becoming ubiquitous, mobile ecommerce is also evolving rapidly. Consumers can shop on mobile devices in two ways; they either open a mobile browser and visit a retailer's website, or download the retailer's mobile app and shop within the app. However, it is unclear how retailers should manage these two emerging channels together. This proposed study aims to investigate the relationship between mobile web and mobile app channels by analyzing how a change to one channel affects the outcome in the other. To infer causality, we utilize an exogenous event in the mobile web channel to assess how it influences the demand of retailers' mobile apps. The results could reveal whether these two mobile channels complement or substitute each other. This study contributes to the literature of multi-channel management in mobile commerce and provides important managerial implications for retailers to better leverage the growing mobile channels.

%X Promotion and online reviews — have been considerably studied separately. Although marketing literature has shown that promotions could influence customer postpurchase evaluative response, little is known about how promotions will affect customer behavior in online reviews. This research examines the effects of promotion on online review ratings. In addition, this study also explores how temporal distance between purchase and posting online review, and customer deal proneness moderate the relationship between promotion and online review ratings. We collect a unique dataset by combining customer transaction records with their behavior in online reviews, and use an ordered probit model to test our hypotheses. Our results show that coupon promotions have a positive impact on online review ratings, and the strength of this impact varies in reverse of the time delay between purchase and posting online reviews. And this relationship is enhanced when customers have high deal proneness.

%X Sharing Economy platforms enable a close physical interaction among strangers by mediating goods and services owned or provided by individuals. This close physical interaction is an inherent part of the service experience, is highly individual and thus can hardly be evaluated beforehand. This gives rise to a novel type of service uncertainty that we term as rapport uncertainty. Building on the hierarchical decomposition of service quality, we construct an uncertainty model that encompasses three uncertainty categories consumers face when sharing a resource: rapport, technical, and environment uncertainty. Our empirical study in a ride sharing context reveals that rapport uncertainty differs from other categories of uncertainty and significantly reduces the intention to transact with a service provider. Our findings illustrate how the concept of uncertainty must be extended to reflect the nature of shared service experiences. We suggest that owners of these platforms should actively manage this aspect through platform design.

%X The Internet of Things (IoT) has entered public awareness due mostly to using IoT devices for creating smart homes. Although IoT provides numerous benefits due to increased information and control, the technology also introduces various vulnerabilities. IoT vendors have rushed products to market with little concern for security or privacy implications. Humans are the weakest link, but there are few opportunities to introduce preventative interventions for mitigating potential security breaches in home contexts. Part of the solution is identifying users' concerns related to the privacy of their IoT-managed information and examining how those concerns are weighed in IoT adoption decisions. In this research, we aim to examine the privacy concerns of IoT users in light of the increased data disclosure that is often central to the utility of IoT devices. We propose an experimental design capturing users' privacy perceptions as well as the actual privacy allowances on their mobile devices.

%X Online recommendation agents (RAs) are increasingly being made available to consumers to facilitate their online shopping decision making. However, some customers may perceive difficulty in using online RAs if they are too complex, particularly older adults who experience limitations in their cognitive abilities. Grounded in the theory of reasoned action, and the aging and information systems adoption literatures, this study proposes a theoretical model to explore the effects of cognitive age and RA complexity on consumers’ intentions to use RAs. An experimental design and research methodology are outlined to validate the proposed model and identify differences between the experiences of younger and older adults in using RAs based on their cognitive age.

%X Information is becoming increasingly available in the form of unstructured data, such as textual materials and visual media. This information represents a decisive driver in electronic commerce, since products are advertised through their descriptions. Recent advances in information technology allow one to analyze these descriptions in a computerized fashion; however, the opposite is true for visual information. There is a dearth of methods by which to interpret images and understand how they are used in decision-making. We propose a prediction based approach to infer the sentiment of images. In our case, we utilize images from real estate listings and predict the corresponding rent price. We succeed in this task by outperforming the naive baseline by up to 62.96%. Our method is thus capable of extracting visual cues in order to reveal the perception of images. This research is of potential value to operators of e-commerce or recommender systems optimizing the presentation of products and services.

%X Recently WOM has become popular with the penetration of Internet and the popularity of social media, and attracted the attention of IS researchers. This study develops a model to explore the factors motivating e-service users’ WOM behavior from the expectation confirmation paradigm together with trust. The research model was empirical tested with 543 valid responses from the online travel service users. The research results indicate that perceived usefulness and user satisfaction affect e-service users’ WOM behavior positively together with trust. Perceived usefulness was found to exert the strongest influence on WOM than satisfaction and trust. The implications to theories and practice are discussed as well.

%X With the popularity of touchscreen tablets and gesture control devices, the role of touch in online consumer behavior has become increasingly important. This study aims to investigate how sense of touch evoked by various interaction modes (i.e., mouse-driven interaction, touchscreen gesture interaction and mid-air gesture interaction) influences virtual product experience. Drawing on Feelings-as-Information Theory and Cognitive-Affective Framework in virtual product experience, we propose that sense of touch could influence consumer purchase intention by reducing product uncertainty and improving product attachment; furthermore, these effects are contingent on product characteristics, i.e., importance of product haptics and product valence. Accordingly, two lab experiments are designed. Potential theoretical contributions, practical implications as well as future research directions are discussed.

%X Cloud customers need to assess whether their cloud service provider offers high-quality services and handles sensitive information confidentially. Privacy protection is therefore a major challenge during cloud sourcing. Although cloud customers want control over their sensitive information, they have limited resources to do so. They therefore consider other control agents, such as certification authorities or collectives, but the effectiveness of these groups to ensure privacy protection is unknown. This study differentiates between three control agents (personal control, proxy control, and collective control) and investigates the influence of these agents on cloud customers’ perceived control over sensitive information to protect privacy during cloud sourcing. Results show that proxy and collective control influence cloud customers’ perceptions but personal control does not. Therefore, only external control agents, who can apply sanctions, are perceived as being able to effectively protect privacy.

%X Mobile services have gradually transformed and broadened, and are still being developed, bringing users  more convenience, ubiquity, universality, and diversification. The mobility and ubiquity of smartphones increase users’ perception of convenience, which can induce online purchases. Consumers can browse webpages on a smartphone find interesting products anywhere and anytime. They may impulsively decide to buy these products or conduct instant chats with friends to obtain product information or recommendations. It is important that we examine users’ emotions when shopping via mobile devices, now that m-commerce is gradually being accepted and used, by investigating factors such as customers’ perceptions of value, immersion, commitment, and pleasure. So, this study investigates consumers’ urge to buy and browsing activities in m-commerce from the emotional perceptive. Findings derived from data analysis of 578 records collected from the online survey. First, the relationship of pleasure, dominance and arousal on urge to buy is demonstrated in m-commerce. Second, results show that pleasure and browsing activities are critical to inducing consumers’ impulsive purchase intention in m-commerce. The total effect of pleasure on the urge to buy is close to 50%. The influence of pleasure on browsing activities is almost twice that of the urge to buy. Third, effects of web atmospherics and mobile characteristics are distinct. Web atmospherics tend to influence consumers’ perceived dominance of mobile websites, thus increasing their perceived control over the interaction process. Mobile characteristics are less important  to arousal and dominance. The most popular characteristics of smartphones for consumers and vendors, ubiquity and localization, do not increase consumers’ perceived dominance and arousal towards mobile websites. Academic and practical implications are discussed further.

%X Big data is increasingly used by organizations to be better able to predict consumer behaviour; therefore, allowing organizations to better forecast customer demand and allocate resources accordingly. As big data use increases, a number of questions about the ethical collection and use of consumer data has arisen. For example, the data obtained for use in big data is not always explicitly provided to organizations from individuals. As a result, ownership of the data is not always clear. Organizations must find a balance in exploiting rich customer data and consumers’ privacy via its practices and information systems development. Further research is required on the social implications of big data and the impact to individual privacy. Previous privacy research has indicated the when organizations encroach on an individual’s personal boundaries; there is an impact on the relationship between consumers and the organization. Given this, it is imperative that organizations determine best practices on the use and collection of personal data. This paper explores the gap in research on privacy and big data and proposes a research agenda to determine the degree to which the factors of control and awareness account for information privacy concerns with big data and how organizations can utilize these factors to mitigate information privacy concerns.

%X As online consumer reviews have tremendously gained in importance for consumer decision-making and firm strategies, scholars have greatly advanced our understanding of the effect of various review characteristics on review helpfulness and product sales. However, the question of what actually caus-es variations in these review characteristics remains largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap and establishes a novel link between online reviews and reviewer personality by arguing that certain personality characteristics of reviewers play a crucial role in shaping the way reviews are composed. Specifically, we draw on an innovative and unobtrusive measure of personality in the context of online behavior by building on theory on political ideology. Numerous scholars have shown that individuals’ political ideologies are a result of stable, underlying personality characteristics. We hypothesize that, as a consequence, reviews by liberals exhibit more cognitively complex language, a greater diversity of arguments, more positively valenced language, a greater number of words, and a greater number of arguments compared to reviews by conservatives. By linking clickstream data to 245 online reviews, we provide support for our hypotheses. We discuss how the concept of political ideology can yield novel insights in online review research and how it allows website managers to provide more tailored incentives to potential reviewers.

%X Despite extensive deliberations in contemporary literature, the design of citizen-centric e-government websites remains an unresolved theoretical and pragmatic conundrum.  Operationalizing e-government service quality to investigate and improve the design of e-government websites has been a much sought-after objective.  Yet, there is a lack of actionable guidance on how to develop e-government websites that exhibit high levels of service quality.  Drawing from marketing literature, we undertake a goal approach to this problem by delineating e-government service quality into aspects of IT-mediated service content and service delivery.  Whereas service content describes the functions available on an e-government website that assist citizens in completing their transactional goals, service delivery defines the manner by which these functions are made accessible via the web interface as a delivery channel.  We construct and empirically test a research model that depicts a comprehensive collection of web-enabled service content functions and delivery dimensions desirable by citizens.  Empirical findings from an online survey of 647 respondents attest to the value of distinguishing between service content functions and delivery dimensions in designing e-government websites.  Both service content and delivery are found to be significant contributors to achieving e-government service quality.  These IT-mediated service content functions and delivery dimensions represent core areas of e-government website design where the application of technology makes a difference, especially when considered in tandem with the type of transactional activity.  A split sample analysis of the data further demonstrates our model’s robustness when applied to e-government transactions of varying frequency.

%X Smartphones, when loaded with a secure software application, can act as a mobile wallet.  When face-to-face in a retail store, consumers are able to swipe their phone over the terminal and complete payment without having to produce the physical card. The number of terminals that accept contactless payments in the USA is growing as the country moves to the adoption of the ‘chip and pin’ standard.  Consumers can choose from wallet providers such as Google, PayPal and ApplePay.  This research seeks to explain the factors that influence adoption.  Data from an empirical study of US consumers is analyzed with PLS and the influence of trust, word of mouth and facilitating conditions are determined to be significant.  After segmenting the data into two groups based on age and with the help of multigroup analysis, age is determined not to be a moderating factor for owners of smartphones.

%X Intense competition among a vast number of group-buying websites leads to higher product homogeneity, which allows customers to switch to alternative websites easily and reduce their website stickiness and loyalty. This study explores the antecedents of user stickiness and loyalty and their effects on consumers’ group-buying repurchase intention. Results indicate that systems quality, information quality, service quality, and alternative system quality each has a positive relationship with user loyalty through user stickiness. Meanwhile, information quality directly impacts user loyalty. Thereafter, user stickiness and loyalty each has a positive relationship with consumers’ repurchase intention. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.

In order to do so, four main infrastructures extracted from literature review have been used to determine the nature of the barriers that have prevented e-commerce from taking off as expected and to explain why Algeria lags behind other countries with similar economic conditions. The results of this investigation demonstrate that, although most of the infrastructures are still growing, but the country still lags behind in terms of its capabilities for providing the required infrastructure for e-commerce.

%X Most mobile consumers make a decision about the product in a split second. The decision making in the mobile environment is surely faster than in front of the desktop. This paper claims that the decision-making in the mobile shopping is highly depending on the product’s first impression and their visual preference. By predicting the human’s visual preference based on the image processing model of perceived colorfulness and perceived visual complexity, this study tested an S-O-R path model from visual preference to consumer’s bookmarking and purchase intention via age and gender as moderators. With the controlled laboratory experiment, we substantiated our predicting image preference model. Further, a plan for a real data based analysis is proposed to validate the congruity of our model with the Korean mobile shopping company later.

%X The purpose of this paper is to explain how micro-entrepreneurs deploy, develop, and manage social media as a resource to create social commerce capabilities to achieve benefits. The paper uses a critical case sampling methodology to select a micro-entrepreneur who uses social media for advertising and retailing fashion items. Three findings emerge. First, in developing of social commerce capabilities, there is need to combine both technical and non-technical resources. Second, personal social capital is not immediately available for use in the development of social commerce capabilities especially when it is being translated for commercial purposes. Third, the level of social commerce capabilities developed is contingent on the affordances of the social media platform in use. This study uncovers the possibility of developing resources and capabilities concurrently i.e. resources do not necessarily have be inputs as identified in the theory. This paper is arguably one of the pioneering attempts at conceptualizing social commerce capabilities.

%X Existing research related to firm growth has not paid sufficient attention to the growth paths of online stores in e-markets. The linkage between growth path and firm size has not been built up. This paper aims to investigate evolutionary trajectories and their effects on firm size. Theoretically, conceptually define three types of distinguishable paths, namely the convergent, tepid, and sustained paths. We then propose related theoretical hypotheses that reflect the impacts of different types of growth paths on the resulting firm size. To empirically validate the proposed hypotheses, we applied the trajectory analysis method with a novel indicator, the relative expansion rate, based on a data set that consists of 5,582 online stores on Taobao.com, the largest e-commerce platform in the world. Testing results largely support our hypotheses and suggest that the sustained growth path is the ideal mode nascent online sellers should struggle for, since it is significantly positively related to the firm size that the sellers can achieve. To achieve their goal of firm expansion, new online sellers should aggressively pursue opportunities in the short term, which is a reflection of the “the growth of the fitter” principle. Our findings also suggest that E-commerce platforms may attempt to facilitate the sustained growth path of sellers through including growth path analysis in the evaluation system of online stores.

%X Although situations influence the use of a technology, this field has been largely neglected in mobile shopping. Therefore, this paper aims to identify situational factors impacting on the intention to use a mobile device for actual purchase transactions, as actual purchases were found to be the least adapted shopping activity conducted via mobile devices. This study contributes to the field of mobile shopping behavior by being the first to simultaneously investigate the influence of various situational factors on the intention to shop mobile. Based on Belk’s five categories of situational factors, we perform a conjoint analysis to explore the relevance of different situational characteristics for low and high involvement products. The results indicate that particularly the product price, the internet connection, and the mobile shop layout determine mobile shopping behavior. Practical actions to strengthen the mobile channel and increase consumers’ intentions to purchase via mobile devices, can be derived from the findings.

%X This paper explores the effects of emotions embedded in a seller review on its perceived helpfulness to readers.  Drawing on frameworks in literature on emotion and cognitive processing, we propose that over and above a well-known negativity bias, the impact of discrete emotions in a review will vary, and that one source of this variance is reader perceptions of reviewers’ cognitive effort.  We focus on the roles of two distinct, negative emotions common to seller reviews:  anxiety and anger.  In the first two studies, experimental methods were utilized to identify and explain the differential impact of anxiety and anger in terms of perceived reviewer effort.  In the third study, seller reviews from Yahoo! Shopping web sites were collected to examine the relationship between emotional review content and helpfulness ratings.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining discrete emotions in online word-of-mouth, and they carry important practical implications for consumers and online retailers.

This study examines the impact of the recommendation system in the popular Google Play mobile app store. By analyzing a 60-day panel dataset with 235,638 observations from 9,735 apps, we investigate how the characteristics of the recommended apps relative to those of the focal apps affect the adoption of mobile apps in this volatile market. Our results show that the relative strength of the recommended apps over the focal app plays a key role in influencing the outcome of recommendations. Moreover, the heterogeneity of the recommendations as represented by the diversity of the popularity of the recommended apps is positively associated with a more even distribution of revenue in the market. These findings provide insights for mobile app market operators to enhance the design of their recommendation systems

%X Institutional operators in the digital marketplace have delighted consumers with precise, highly personalized and customized products and services through the collection and mining of customers’ personally identifiable data. However, the ethical conduct of online businesses continues to be a debatable issue, due to the increasing concerns over information privacy. Despite such controversies, scrutiny of consumer behavior has shown that consumers’ concerns for privacy do not transfer into protective behaviors or abstinence during online activity. The aim of this study is to illuminate the disparity known as the -˜privacy paradox’ through the directions of the construal level theory. Based on semi-structured interviews with 21 online shopping consumers, we explain that, due to spatial, temporal, social, and hypothetical distance of privacy values, privacy is construed as an abstract phenomenon influencing the formation of distant-future attitudes and intentions rather than actual behavior.

This study examines how network externality, in terms of direct network externality and indirect network externality, enhances B2B platform users' perceived value, and how such perception of value, in turn, influences their satisfaction and loyalty. First, we develop a conceptual model to describe the formation mechanism of user (seller) loyalty on B2B platform. Second, based on literature home and abroad, we develop a questionnaire. With a well-known B2B platform, we get 1,348 valid samples. At last, using structural equation modeling approach, we get the conceptual model fitted. The empirical results show that: network externality can be used as pre-drivers of perceived value thereby affecting user loyalty, but it has no direct influence on user satisfaction.

%X As mobile apparel retail websites and apps grow in popularity, insight into the psychology and behaviours of shoppers using these mobile interfaces has become more important. Although Android operated mobile devices dominate the market, the current study of fashion consumers’ opinions shows that, in terms of fashion shopping via mobile devices, Apple’s iOS is leading. The data show that mostly females aged 18 to 34 years old purchase clothing via smart phones, and consumers using iOS smart phones purchase more clothing via mobile than Android OS. Over 60% of respondents prefer to use websites on their mobile devices despite the wide range of mobile apps available. 70% of respondents think that ’website and products do not display properly on the small screen’. This is the first study focusing on critical issues of fashion m-retail’s environment based on mobile fashion consumers’ behaviour and shopping experience. Five mobile fashion consumer types - self-confident addicted shoppers, time-conscious consumers, followers, bargain hunters and style-conscious connected browsers - were identified. Appropriate marketing strategies can be developed, guided by the specific mobile fashion consumer type’s shopping journey, and apparel retailers can better define their target consumers and more effectively tailor mobile interfaces to meet customer needs.

%X This applied research focuses on knowledge-intensive business processes (KIBPs) supported by Business Intelligence and Analytics (BI&A), here termed BI&A-supported KIBPs. Examples of these processes include customer-support services, risk and assurance processes, and design of marketing campaigns. This research aims to investigate an industry-informed research challenge of ongoing improvement of BI&A-supported KIBPs, in particular the role of BI&A in process improvement. This paper presents a qualitative research case study, conducted in a large retail distribution company, using a theoretical lens of Work Systems Theory (WST). We describe an innovative approach to ongoing improvement of BI&A-supported KIBP and confirm an important role played by BI&A in this context. Informed by these research insights, we then propose a new theoretical model of ongoing improvement of BI&A-supported KIBP and explain its significance using relevant literature. The model is also highly relevant for industry practitioners looking for new sources of competitive differentiation, beyond BI&A technology.

%X The adoption rate of Internet banking services (IBS) is considered to be relatively high in the developed countries; which is not the case for developing countries. The lack of trust plays a vital role in discouraging users from adopting IBS. Therefore, initial trust could be the starting point of making customers comfortable processing their banking transactions online. This study aims to propose a conceptual model of initial trust in IBS in developing countries. The proposed model integrates its constructs from: the trust literature, diffusion of innovation theory (DoI), and Hofstede’s national culture theory. This paper also aims to develop and validate a research instrument in order to examine the proposed model. We conducted a pilot study in Jordan, which is one of the developing countries, and refined the model and its instrument based on the obtained results.

%X Online product recommendation (OPR) has received much attention in industry and academics, but less attention has been paid in exploring and understanding how different sources of recommendation influences consumers’ evaluation beliefs and behavior, and whether these impacts are relatively different for different types of products in their OPR continuous usage and product purchase intentions. This study aims to examine the distinct effects of system generated recommendation (SGR) and consumer generated recommendation (CGR) on consumers’ decision, affective, and social-psychological beliefs of OPR evaluation and to assess how these OPR evaluation beliefs subsequently effect consumers’ OPR continuous usage and purchase intentions. Results of a cross-sectional survey with 453 Amazon customers show that users of CGR express significantly higher trusting beliefs and perceived decision quality than users of SGR, while users of SGR elicit higher perceived enjoyment and lower perceived decision effort than users of CGR, resulting in different effect mechanisms toward OPR continuous usage and purchase intentions. Additionally, results also showed that product type (search & experience) significantly moderate the effects of OPR use on consumers’ OPR evaluation beliefs, indicating the way different type of recommendation sources (SGR vs CGR) for different types of product are comprehended and assessed. The findings are potentially beneficial to e-retailers who want to design sales-efficient websites by effectively employing OPR which improve consumers’ experience of buying different types of products.

%X In an online marketplace reality in which customer satisfaction emerges as a key success factor for e- retailers, it becomes crucial to better understand whether the shoppers are satisfied and what factors affect their satisfaction experience. As we are in the Big Data era, Business Analytic techniques could assist us to better understand our customers and their respective satisfaction. To this end, this paper presents a data mining based approach to identify different satisfaction patterns/profiles from satisfaction survey responses. This approach was applied on data from over 120 Greek e-shops across 18 industries. Apart from its theoretical contribution, the proposed approach extracts hidden satisfaction patterns with a view to better understand the specific needs and preferences of customers. These insights may be used to support several decisions, ranging from marketing actions per customer satisfaction profile, to actionable decision making and customer-oriented strategies

%X Attracting millions of users world-wide, online gaming is perceived as a profitable e-business with great research potentials. This study proposes a behavioral consequence research model linking service quality, service value, satisfaction and behavioral intentions with a central focus on the moderating effect of Zone of Tolerance (ZOT), which serves as a standard for service evaluation by forming a cognitive boundary of satisfactory service, in the context of massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The necessity of customizing conventional e-service quality measures is highlighted in order to reflect the distinctiveness of online game service attributes when undertaking empirical tests. On the basis of solid conceptualization, our research model is expected to explain the variability of online game players’ rating on satisfaction and their subsequent behavioral intentions. Lastly, several implications noted in this study are presented.

%X In consumer and information systems research, it remains unclear how consumers consider smartphone app recommendations in the course of their decision making process that leads to product choices in the physical store. Moreover, it is unclear which type of information smartphone apps should transport to consumers and if there are any customer segmentation criteria for smartphone app design. With respect to the theoretical and managerial importance of recommendation services in the form of smartphone apps we want to shed some light on this topic. Combining literature from the fields of IS and marketing research, we hypothesize that personalized recommendations via smartphone apps can help to boost sales in physical grocery stores. Furthermore, we hypothesize that additional popularity information (in the form of “stars”) does not amplify the positive effect of personalized recommendations. In addition, we assume that the effects of recommendation usage differ for men and women. We conducted a field study with a European grocery retailer to test our hypotheses. Finally, we discuss first implications as well as central limitations of our research and present the next research steps.

%X This research explores factors that impact people’s trust and subsequently their willingness to participate in the sharing economy and how the factors are different from those identified in e-commerce context. The study was conducted in two phases. The Phase I study was an exploratory study with openended questions. The Phase II study will be conducted to test seven hypotheses. The Phase I study revealed that the sharing economy is still in its early stage but is gaining momentum. The results indicated that the biggest inhibitor for the sharing economy might be the physical security. The evidences seem to highlight the importance of enhanced background checks on participating members as well as adoption of additional security measures such as security certificate and safety insurance.

%X Along with recent advancement of web technologies, social networking sites (SNSs) affect people’s life styles by enabling them to perform different activities which are not easy to do before. Predominant uses of SNSs allow users to quickly access and easily share personal information. In turn, users’ information privacy issues become important challenge. Drawing upon Protection Motivation Theory, this research investigates the effect of privacy assurance mechanisms (i.e., privacy assurance statements and privacy customization) on privacy concern and disclosure behavior. The results show that privacy assurance statements significantly influence SNS users’ privacy concern by affecting users’ assessment of threat susceptibility and effectiveness of assurance mechanisms; privacy customization features significantly influence users’ self-efficacy and perceived effectiveness of assurance mechanisms; SNS users’ privacy concern results form a risk calculus process in which users assess the threat and available coping mechanisms; and the effect of privacy concern on self-disclosure mediates by users’ protection motivation.

%X In recent years, smart phone market has risen and the demands of mobile applications increase sharply. Daily mobile applications have shown their great potential and influences throughout mobile commerce. Mobile TV app is one of the most popular mobile applications in the entertainment genre. Advances in 4G mobile network make high-quality mobile TV and video streaming apps prospective. With the emergence of mobile TV apps, there is a pressing need to understand the determinants of users' intention to use and willingness to pay. This study aims to advance our understanding of the factors that influence the intention to use and willingness to pay for mobile TV apps by triangulating the social cognitive theory, motivation theory and the notion of perceived value. An empirical survey of 497 subjects who have used the mobile TV app was conducted to examine our proposed model. The results reveal that interpersonal/external social influence, personal mobile innovativeness, perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived utilitarian/hedonic value significantly affect an individual's intention to use mobile TV apps, while mobile-specific self-efficacy does not. On the other hand, perceived utilitarian value and perceived hedonic value influence a user’s willingness to pay. Theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.

%X Trust is an important factor for improving e-commerce purchase intention. Nonetheless, the study of information technology (IT) artifact design and evaluation as a direct predictor to trust still remains at a preliminary stage. This research attempts to suggest and examine a model of cognitive and emotional trust in human image as one type of IT artifact. Referring to the similarity-attraction theory, we develop a research model. The model depicts that customer’s purchase intention is influenced by two dimensions of web interactivity, namely active control and reciprocal communication, which is mediated by a newly proposed construct, called perceived human image appeal similarity (PHIAS). This novel construct also helps to improve the formation of cognitive trust, emotional trust and eventually customer’s purchase intention. We plan to conduct an empirical study to test the hypotheses.

%X Effective online review component design plays a critical role in facilitating online transactions. Although there is abundant evidence that consumer reviews have significant impact on product sales, the design of consumer review systems and its impact on consumers’ beliefs about online reviews and subsequent purchase decisions have not yet been thoroughly examined. Little theoretical knowledge is available about how review components may influence consumers’ beliefs, attitudes and behavior. In this paper, we develop a conceptual model for measuring the impact of review components on the beliefs and behavior of online customers. In developing the theoretical model (called the influence of review components model, or IRCM), we synthesize the theory of reasoned action with theories in social psychology, consumer behavior, and trust to categorize review components and conceptualize the salient beliefs of consumers toward online reviews. We expect that IRCM and its empirical results provide an initial guideline for a rigorous approach to designing online review systems and testing their effectiveness before full deployment

%X Recently, it is catching considerable attention that more people are making money through social media. Those most-followed users have started to sell products online rather than purely earning through advertisements. Whether and how social media interactions (tweet, retweet, comment) affect these product sales remain underexplored. Moreover, extent literature mainly focuses on traditional companies rather than currently booming individuals (Internet stars) on social media platforms. We explore this question with uniquely matched datasets from leading tweeting platform (Sina Weibo) and e-commerce market (Taobao). We aim to empirically examine how the product sales on e-market are affected by the advertising effects (i.e., the store owners’ tweets, the influential users’ retweets) and the user engagement efforts (i.e., average users’ retweets and comments). We expect that both effects will lead to increased sales but with different mechanisms and that these effects are diminishing as the owner becoming more and more popular.

%X Launching a new product usually involves uncertainty. The rapid development of e-commerce stimulates social learning in social networks, profoundly changing consumers’ behaviors. Online product reviews can be classified into first-party and third-party ones regarding publishing channels, but different manipulations of first-party reviews could affect their credibility. Moreover, third-party reviews may provide solutions to above mentioned problems to some extent. However, many prior studies have been conducted on how single-channel social learning affects pricing schemes, ignoring effects of multi-channel social learning and fake reviews. This study aims to fill up the gaps by constructing stylized mathematical and empirical models to investigate consumers’ decision rules and monopolist’s two dynamic pricing policies given dual-channel social learning and different reviews manipulations. The ultimate purpose of this research is to provide useful guidelines for pricing new products and the governance of E-commerce market, which may be relevant to future research of big data in finance.

%X The measurement of the effectiveness of a marketing campaign is a challenging task. Whereas established approaches do not consider causality, uplift models take into account which customers display some behavior because of the marketing action and model this target as differential response. The paper categorizes existing approaches toward uplift modeling collected from different fields into a conceptual taxonomy to establish the state-of-the-art and proposes a novel approach named revenue uplift modeling. Contrary to existing approaches, which model incremental response, revenue uplift models predict the incremental revenue with the goal to maximize the gain per marketing incentive for heterogeneous customers. An experiment based on a large real-world dataset of e-commerce shops across several industries provides a benchmark on the choice of machine learning methods to implement the identified uplift modeling approaches and demonstrates the effectiveness of the revenue uplift model in a real-world e-commerce environment.

%X Designing an appropriate online social referral incentive system allows websites to increase their customer base and enhance sales. This study integrates ultimatum game theory with construal level theory to investigate the impacts of social distance, social norms, and monetary incentives on the performance of online social referral incentive systems. Controlled lab experiments and randomized field experiments with an online ticketing company were conducted to test our hypotheses. Results from the lab and field show that with small social distance, the success of a referral is determined by the social norms between friends but not by the split of the referral bonus; with a large social distance, the success of the referral is determined by a fair split of the bonus between acquaintances. By studying the dynamics of social networking, our research stresses the role of social elements in e-commerce when rational economic rules can be potentially harmful.

%X Consumers’ purchase decisions can be affected by their offline peers, or offline neighborhoods, and their online peers, or online friendships. Although both offline and online peer influence have been shown to affect consumer behavior, researchers have provided limited insights into how these two forms of social influence might differ from and interact with each other. Using a unique panel data set, this study examines two issues regarding the two forms of peer influence: (1) their impact on consumer purchase behavior, and (2) their interaction effects. Our findings reveal that both offline and online peer influence can affect customer purchase decisions, and there is a substitution effect between them. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are also discussed.

%X The concept of “product type” (experience versus search product) is increasingly important in business research and practice. However, it is not defined or measured precisely in the Internet age due to significantly lower search cost and changes in consumer information search behavior resulting from reliance on information and communications technology. We take advantage of the greatly available micro level online word-of-mouth data and infer product type based on statistical properties of online word of mouth (specifically, online product reviews). We draw on the theories from statistics and literature on informational content of online product reviews to analytically propose a mechanism to classify products. We further collect archival data to categorize the products and services. Implications of this analytical tool and empirical findings for research, theory and managerial practice are discussed.

%X In recent times, digital multi-sided platforms (DMSPs) have revolutionized electronic commerce by enabling new forms of competition and collaboration. Existing studies provide useful insights yet do not recognize the role of information technologies (IT) in examining the development of DMSPs. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a case study of Alibaba.com (henceforth simply Alibaba), the largest online B2B marketplace in the world with over 80 million members. We applied the theoretical notion of IT affordances to examine the possibilities for competitive action at a platform level based on organizational variables and IT features in the context of the environment in which they function. Our findings show that, toward market leadership, Alibaba has developed competitive actions from actualizing IT affordances. At Alibaba, actualizing IT affordances links closely with its defined organizational goals of developing: (1) a collectivist structure, (2) a coopetitive structure, and (3) an autonomous community among platform constituents. Our stage-wise model captures the relational aspects of IT affordances and proposes actionable prescriptions for a DMSP to achieve market leadership.

%X We examine the effect of the variance of consumer ratings on product pricing and sales using an analytical model, which considers goods that are characterized by experience attributes and informed search attributes (i.e., experience attributes that were transformed in search attributes by consumer ratings). For pure informed search goods, equilibrium price increases and demand decreases in variance. For pure experience goods, equilibrium price and demand decrease in variance. For hybrid goods with low total variance, equilibrium price and demand increase with an increasing relative share of variance caused by informed search attributes when the average rating and total variance of ratings are held constant. Hence, risk-averse consumers may prefer a more expensive good with a higher variance of ratings out of two similar goods with the same average rating. Moreover, our analytical model provides a theoretical foundation for the empirically observed j-shaped distribution of consumer ratings in electronic commerce.

%X Online social shopping communities are gradually becoming prevalent with the dissemination of e-commerce and social media. Community users or consumers can generate their own contents or engage in social activities while shopping without switching between platforms. The level of engagement and actual purchase, however, are unsatisfactory. Although, prior scholars have examined possible factors (e.g. satisfaction, experience) that can improve participation or purchase in community, they have failed to explore their internal relationships. In this research, we unpack the concept of user satisfaction and adopt the four-dimension user experience principle to improve participation and purchase intention more efficiently. We assume that different components of user experience may have distinct influences on economic and social user satisfaction. Moreover, the impacts of economic and social satisfaction on participation and purchase may differ. An empirical survey of users in online social shopping communities in China will be conducted to test the assumptions. Potential implications for theory and practice will also be discussed.

%X As online reviews play an increasingly influential role in consumer decisions in e-commerce, large online retailers such as Amazon recently launched expert reviewer programs to supply high-quality reviews by selected experts. While prior studies examined the impact of online reviews written by experts on the product’s sales performance, our study investigates the effects of soliciting users to join expert reviewer programs and offering free products on their review generation processes and outcomes.  Contrary to the common wisdom, our results reveal that, after reviewers participate in expert reviewer programs, they generate longer reviews but offer lower ratings for sponsored free products. However, they produce more reviews and higher ratings for non-sponsored regular products. Additional analyses offer theoretical underpinnings for the asymmetric effects of expert reviewer programs.

%X The internet has become part of everyday life and revolutionized the shopping experience. Consumers’ emotional responses play an important role in predicting and measuring behavioral intentions and satisfaction; therefore, it is imperative to study e-commerce from an affective perspective.This research adopted the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model to examine the effects of web atmospheric cues, mainly vividness and interactivity, on users’ emotional responses in e-commerce, and the influence of users’ emotional responses on their purchasing intentions.
%X This research involved three stages: a pretest, an experimental study, and an online survey. First, recruited experts in human-computer interaction (HCI) evaluated 25 different e-commerce websites on interactivity and vividness. These ratings informed the selection of three websites to represent various levels of atmospheric cues: high interactivity and vividness, medium interactivity and vividness, and low interactivity and vividness. In the second stage, an experiment was conducted to collect the physiological responses of 20 participants, including galvanic skin response, heart rate variability, and pupil dilation, as they viewed each of the three e-commerce websites; participants’ self-reported emotional responses were also recorded. Finally, an online survey collected data on the emotional responses and purchase intentions of 53 participants after viewing the three e-commerce websites. The results of the experimental study indicate that web atmospheric cues such as vividness and interactivity had significant positive effects on users’ valence and arousal rates. Furthermore, users experiencing higher arousal and more positive valence rates reported higher intentions to purchase from the e-commerce website. Analysis of the physiological data showed that users’ heart rate variability exhibited a trend similar to that of their self-reported valance rate, but no such trend was observed for self-reported arousal rates, galvanic skin response, or pupil dilation values.
%X This paper not only extends the S-O-R paradigm in the e-commerce context and provides empirical evidence for the model, but also applies Russel’s (1980) emotional model to understand the users’ emotional responses to e-commerce websites. The physiological measures employed in this study are examples of new usability evaluation tools for determining complex affective measures in HCI.

%X In recent years, agricultural e-commerce sales model is in full swing. As the nation’s largest B2C e-commerce company of agricultural products, ShanXi GongTianXia E-commerce Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "GongTianXia ") launched the "7-day auction" and "15-minute auction" since the end of 2014 on their official Wechat platform. Through these two new sales patterns, GongTianXia wants to attract more customers’ attention to agricultural products, and thus lead to greater trade volume and profits.Many studies have shown that "calendar effect" has a wide range of use in financial markets. Likewise, as temporal-series data, did GongTianXia’s two kinds of price reduction auctions have similarities with the laws of financial markets? There’s no research to prove it so far. Taking GongTianXia’s over 200,000 transactions data occurred during 432 instances of “7-day auction” and 943 instances of “15-minute auction” within 2015, this paper discusses the impacts of different periods of “significant time points” under both “7-day auction” and “15-minute auction” on different types of commodities, then explain why those results may happen. With the fin dings, we can improve calender effect theory and make a theoretical complement for Dutch auction as Mobile commerce, and give more optimization advices on mobile commerce companies.

%X Consumer review systems have become an important marketing communication tool through which consumers share and learn product information. This paper aims to analyze the review system design as firms’ strategic decision to facilitate consumer sharing and learning about their products. We show that firms’ optimal pricing and review system design decisions critically depend on contextual characteristics including product quality, product popularity, and consumer misfit cost. Our results suggest that firms choose a low rating scale for niche products and a high rating scale for popular products. Different pricing strategies should be deployed during the initial sale period for different product types. For niche products, firms are advised to adopt lower-bound pricing for high-quality products to take advantage of the positive word-of-mouth. For popular products, firms are advised to adopt upper-bound pricing for high-quality products to enjoy the direct profit from the initial sale without damaging the product review outcomes.

%X Social commerce combines commercial and social activities, and has managed in a very short period of time to attract the interest of researchers and practitioners. In this study we use theories of trust and value co-creation to understand how word-of-mouth (WOM) affects purchase intentions in social commerce settings. Drawing on a sample of 385 survey-based responses from users of social commerce platforms, we empirically examine a set of hypotheses by means of partial least squares analysis. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate that WOM has a direct effect on purchase intentions, as well as an indirect one by developing a sense of trust to consumers. WOM and its impact on trust also has a positive effect on a consumers’ propensity to engage in value co-creation, which ultimately contributes to increased levels of purchase intentions. In closing, theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and limitations of the study are highlighted.

%X Internet shopping is becoming the fastest-growing use of the Internet; however, some online consumers still take information gathered online to make purchases offline. A number of researchers attribute consumers’ reluctance to purchase online to perceived risk. This study investigates differences in perceived risk between online shoppers in the UK and China examining six types of perceived risk: financial, product performance, psychological, social, physical, and time risk. The results indicate that both British and Chinese Internet users have a similar aggregated degree of perceived risk. Findings also suggest that while cultural differences might significantly affect relative differences in three specific types of perceived risk, there is not as much variation as might be expected from Hofstede’s uncertainty avoidance dimension.

%X In the last few decades many firms have been making large investments in e-commerce applications, digital technologies or the use of the Internet in several business activities and processes, giving rise to the notions of digital business and digital economy. Consequently, the number of academic articles on digital business has grown exponentially. The aim of this study is to present the evolution of academic research in digital business between 1990 and 2015. The main contribution is to provide an overview of the current academic state of the art in digital business research. The analysis focuses on identifying the most productive and influential journals in digital business research, as well as the leading authors in the field. The results show a strong increase in digital business research during the last fifteen years due to the development of a good number of specialized journals of information systems. We suggest that the field of business research should expand beyond its traditional boundaries and embrace a more multidisciplinary perspective.

%X Redress is a post-purchase complaint procedure that necessitates some form of compensation for consumers who lodge complaints about a defective product or poor level of service. Its importance in relation to offline business activities has received some research interest, and it is widely accepted that redress has a significant influence on consumer trust in that environment. However, redress has yet to be adequately understood in connection to online purchasing, and research into its role in this context has been sparse. This paper focuses on the influence of redress procedures on the decisions of consumers to purchase online, through an analysis of the perceptions of a selected group of online consumers and merchants.

%X Business digitization has become an important topic in both management practice and academic research. The purpose of this research is to further illuminate and describe the conditions under which a digital business strategy can contribute to achieving strategic advantages. Drawing on configuration theory and using a configurational approach based on fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), we explore configurations of digital business strategy, factors related to firms' market approaches, and environmental factors to explain superior market performance. The findings of our study indicate four distinct configurations that differ in their particular composition, but that are consistently sufficient pathways for high market performance. Knowledge of these configurations deepens the understanding of the complex causal patterns among key elements of digital ecodynamics and provides strategic choices for management practice.

%X The purpose of this research is to analyze the service quality of property websites in Indonesia in order to help website owners in evaluating their websites. The service quality of the websites is measured by adapting the SERVQUAL method which measures the gap between visitor’s expectation and satisfaction. SERVQUAL in this study was constructed by adapting Web Quality Factors. In addition, considering the unique condition of Indonesia and the various technological advancements, we aim to formulate important features of property websites in Indonesia by asking the respondents to rate the importance of each feature. We circulated questionnaires to property exhibition events in Jakarta and received 101 valid questionnaires from 204 respondents. The results showed that respondents considered the service quality of the websites to still be under their expectations in all SERVQUAL dimensions which include reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness. Furthermore, we successfully identified significant features of property websites and extracted important characteristics for developing countries' context. Some of which are currently unavailable in the Indonesian property information provider websites.

%X Crowdfunding (CF) is gaining much attention in theory and practice. Various platforms have emerged, offering the possibility to raise money from an undefined group of online users. Despite the growing interest, there appears to be little understanding of what influences backers funding behavior as well as their intention to return to a CF-platform. Due to the analogies of e-commerce and reward- based CF, we address this issue by drawing on e-commerce theory, mainly online-product- presentation. It was proven that online-product-presentation is a successful influencing factor on consumer's behavior. Based on this, we aim at developing a theory ingrained research model to analyze and understand the impact of online-product-presentation elements on funding and returning behavior of backers in reward-based CF. Our research is the first empirical attempt to investigate these effects in the context of reward-based CF. Doing so, our research contributes to the body of online-product- presentation theory by applying it into a new context. The results have practical implications for effective product presentations in reward-based CF. It helps crowdfunding intermediaries and individuals to understand the importance of online-product-presentation, and provides them with actionable ad- vice on how to handle them on, among others, platform design and online product promotion.

%X E-commerce consumers are facing increasingly complex purchasing decisions. Due to their cognitive capacity, however, consumers may not always achieve their goal of optimal product choice. Existing research has focused on providing aids to consumers to help them make rational and conscious information choices for complex purchasing decisions. Recently, a dual-process Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) has suggested otherwise. It shows that due to the limited cognitive resources, unconscious information processing may outperform conscious information processing for complex decisions. Drawing on the UTT, the study proposes that strategically designed interventions would interact with other contextual and individual factors in consumer information processing, and ultimately lead to superior consumer choice under certain choice environment. An experiment was conducted to test the research model. Focusing on the unconscious information processing in online shopping, this study has important implications for Web-specific human-computer interaction research and e-commerce practitioners.

And the relationship between involvement and recovery satisfaction is also tested. Structural equation modelling is used in our study. Based on the analysis of 266 questionnaires collected through a professional survey website, we find that perceived risk moderates the relationship between recovery satisfaction, attitudinal loyalty and behavioural loyalty, and involvement has a positive effect on recovery satisfaction. The managerial and theoretical implications of the study have also been provided.

%X A critical challenge faced by omni-channel retailers is how to effectively manage customer touchpoints to influence customer demand. However, past studies have not examined the relative effectiveness, spillovers or interdependencies of customer touchpoints in omni-channel environments. To address these gaps, we aim to examine the relative effectiveness of different touchpoints in terms of owned, paid and earned media, the spillovers of touchpoint exposures from/to focal and rival brands, and the interdependencies among different omni-channel touchpoints. Using data from an international omni-channel retailer, we conducted empirical analyses with simultaneous estimations of customers’ purchase choice, quantity and expenditure. Our preliminary results show that (1) owned (paid) media touchpoint exposure is more effective than that of paid (earned) media in influencing purchases, (2) owned media touchpoint exposures of rival brands influence customers’ demand for focal brands, (3) owned and paid media touchpoint exposures have substitution relationships in affecting customers’ demand for focal brands.

%X Information overload has been studied extensively by decision science researchers, particularly in the context of task-based optimization decisions. Media selection research has similarly investigated the extent to which task characteristics influence media choice and use. This paper outlines a proposed study, which would compare the effectiveness of web-based online product review systems in facilitation trust and purchase intention to those of mobile product review systems. We propose that since web-based systems are more effective in fostering focus and are less prone to navigation frustration, information overload is less likely influence the extent to which a consumer trusts an online product review.

%X Determinants of online consumer’s purchase decisions are of long-term interest to researchers and practitioners. Since product photos directly aid consumers’ understanding of products, retailers often put a lot of effort into polishing them. However, there is limited research on the impact of product photos on purchase decisions. Most previous studies took an experiment-based approach, which delivered strict theories on some aspects of product photos. This research takes advantage of image-processing techniques to study product photos’ impact. These techniques allow us to investigate a large set of photo characteristics simultaneously in an empirical study. To rule out possible confounding factors, we collect a dataset from a social shopping Website, which has a simple interface allowing users to judge products mainly based on their photos. We examine product photo characteristics from the aspects of information, emotion, aesthetics, and social presence. We found that consumers prefer product photos with a larger key object, lower entropy on key objects, a warmer color, a higher contrast, a higher depth-of-field, and more social presences. This research introduces a Big Data-based approach to study the impact of e-commerce systems’ visual features on consumers.

Main results of the study are the existence of primary and secondary transition activities and the existence of a discrepancy between actions taken and their perceived degree of importance. One main conclusion is that the combination of value creating activities an SME should focus on during different stages of an online channel expansion differ depending on transition category and will change over time.

%X Based on a large-scale, unique longitudinal dataset comprising more than four million individual transactions, we study linkages between consumer learning, channel choice, and purchase behavior. We focus on online versus traditional over the counter channels. First, we investigate how the occurrence of consumer ‘learning’ is related to ‘unlearning’ in loyalty programs, and how (un)learning depends on the chosen channel. Second, we study how (un)learning effects, along with other contingent factors, impact customer loyalty, and explore whether the strength and/or significance of effects change over time. Hypotheses are tested in the context of two-part pricing schemes in travel services that are particularly intended to create loyalty, and offer a rare opportunity for an objective assessment of learning effects. Results show that (un)learning, as well as channel choice, and pricing issues, are significantly associated with contract cancelation. We provide managerial implications that help firms re-develop, communicate and fine-tune loyalty programs more effectively.

%X Online review is an important form of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) that helps customers make purchasing decisions. In a set of reviews, the review with the most helpfulness votes are seen as most helpful. While researchers have demonstrated how review and reviewer characteristics influence helpfulness votes, a largely uninvestigated issue is how herding behaviors can influence customers’ voting participation and direction. Drawing on herd behavior literature, we propose that review voters will discount their own information when faced with clear and strong signals from previous voters. Thus, they will herd previous voters’ voting direction. On the other hand, review voters will value their own judgments when faced with weak signals from previous voters. Herding can influence both a voter’s perception of a review’s helpfulness and his/her vote. This research extends review helpfulness literature that herd behaviors could moderates customers’ perception of review helpfulness and voting direction.

%X O2O, an acronym of online-to-offline or vice versa, is a new business model blending online retailing with offline retailing. This new model improves an existing method of shopping by either integrating the online components for traditional shoppers or the traditional shopping for Internet or mobile shoppers. Few studies have examined consumers’ acceptance of new O2O business model. Therefore, this study attempts to investigate consumer acceptance of O2O business model from the status quo bias and habit perspectives that have been used to examine new system acceptance by past research. Using a sample data collected from 230 respondents, this study applies a structural equation model (SEM) to examine the relationships of the proposed research model. The results reveal that behavioural-based inertia positively impacts perceived ease of use and cognitive-based inertia positively impacts relative advantage, and consequently impacts consumers’ intention to use O2O shopping. In addition, subjective norm positively impacts perceived ease of use and relative advantage, and self-efficacy positively impacts perceived ease of use. Because O2O shopping is a consumer’s adoption of a new business model which involves information technologies and retailing services, this study thus provides in depth insights into enhancing the acceptance of both new information technologies and new business model. Particularly, inertia can facilitate consumers O2O shopping acceptance as opposed to inhibit new system acceptance found in past research. Perceived ease of use and relative advantage fully mediate the relationships between external variables (such as inertia, subjective norm, and self-efficacy) and O2O shopping intention. Implications are drawn for electronic commerce, mobile commerce, and retailing.

%X Software-as-a-Service, a new model of accessing software presents individual users with tremendous opportunities to work and live conveniently and efficiently. However, the challenges that come with SaaS are equally highlighted and deserve careful attention from researchers. Among them, privacy has emerged as the key inhibitor of SaaS adoption and use among individual users. The purpose of this study is to understand the specific privacy concerns that inhibit SaaS adoption and analyze the key benefits that are weighted against such privacy concerns by individual users in their decision process of using SaaS. We expect this study to have both academic and practical implications. For researchers, this study will provide an empirically-verified framework focused on privacy issues and key benefits specific to SaaS at individual level which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been developed. For SaaS providers, this study will enhance their understanding on the most salient privacy issues raised by individual users and how to address them by increasing the key benefits driving adoption. Consequently, SaaS providers will be able to develop user-centered services that minimize their privacy concerns and maximize their benefits.

%X Micro blog has become an important platform of consumer-company interaction to enhance brand loyalty. A relational model is proposed to study the influence of company micro blog interaction on customer micro blog stickiness and brand loyally, based on use and gratification theory, organization support theory and union participation theory. Results show that company interaction tactics include two forms: relational interaction and commercial interaction. Relational interaction positively influences consumers ’ perceived socioemotional support and perceived informationsupport. Commercial interaction positively influence perceived information support. Perceived socioemotional support and information support are positively related to consumer micro blog stickiness, which is positively related to brand loyalty. In sum, relational interaction is more important in attracting sticky consumers and brand loyalty. Finally, some recommendations are presented for micro blog branding.

%X As mobile phones and tablets are in widespread use, the emergence of mobile channel is changing the way customers interact with financial institutions. In this research, we empirically examine how the use of mobile devices can improve customer informedness and affect customer behavior in financial transactions. We use a large-scale customer transaction data obtained from one of the largest commercial banks in the United States. Specifically, we investigate: (1) whether the use of mobile phones and tablets is associated with a higher level of customer informedness and demand for services; and (2) compared to customers that only transact through a PC, whether mobile phone and tablet users are less likely to incur overdraft and credit card penalty fees. This paper contributes new knowledge in omni-channel banking services by examining post-adoption customer behavioral changes using transaction-level observations. We also discuss insights for banks’ managers related to the design of new mobile channel, and strategic management of existing digital and physical channels.

%X The rapid development of internet of things (IoT), big data and ubiquitous computing is making ubiquitous commerce (U-commerce) the next business wave. U-commerce is a dynamic convergence of the click and mortar world, which empowers consumers to interact with virtual and physical objects within the U-commerce environment. This user involvement creates unique consumer experiences in a U-commerce environment that traditional electronic channels, such as E-commerce, are unable to replicate. Applying Activity Theory, we identify personalized incentive and contextual facilitation which influence consumers’ situational involvement and unique experiences in a U-commerce environment. Using 256 valid empirical data, the research results show that (1) contextual facilitation and personalized incentive positively affect consumers’ situational involvement and unique experiences, (2) Situational involvement positively affects unique experiences: usability and hedonic experience.

%X Conscious and automatic information processing modes represent two approaches to deal with IS continuance. Existing IS studies mostly viewed them as two independent systems and examined IS continuance through either a cognitive deliberating process or an automatic process. In this study, we attempt to clarify the complex nature of IS continuance by examining various interactions between the two information processes. Particularly, we argued that habit activates the heuristic information processing mode and facilitates consumers’ decision making through interacting with key elements of the rational decision process. We conducted a longitudinal study to empirically test the research model with 385 consumers of an e-commerce website. The results show that the two information processing modes work in parallel to explain consumers’ continuance decision. Satisfaction, perceived enjoyment, and alternative attractiveness have significant direct effects on continuance intention. Furthermore, habit exhibits a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between alternative attractiveness and continuance intention. We believe that this study provides new insights to both IS research and practice.

%X Many e-stores offer product recommendation services to increase sales and customers’ satisfaction. However, previous studies indicate that the performance of recommendation systems may be influenced by consumers’ perception of the recommended products, which may be affected by how the product was recommended. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of product type and recommendation approach on consumers’ intention to purchase recommended products. A laboratory experiment was conducted to collect empirical data and ANCOVA was adopted to test our research hypotheses. We found significant interaction effects between recommendation approach and product type on consumers’ intention to buy the recommended products and their disconfirmation of the recommended products. Before experiencing the products, consumers’ purchase intention was significantly higher for search goods when they were recommended by the Top-N approach than when they were recommended by the collaborative filtering approach. After experiencing the products, however, consumers’ disconfirmation was significantly higher for experience goods when they were recommended by the Top-N approach than when they were recommended by the collaborative-filtering approach. Furthermore, the disconfirmation of experience goods was significantly higher than that of search goods when they were recommended by the Top-N approach. Our findings provide valuable insights into choosing product recommendation approaches for different types of products.

%X As e-commerce offers new channels for companies to reach consumers, it also brings about significant challenges to the ability to response to customer changing needs, which is named “customer agility”. Both practitioners and researchers consider information management as a source of customer agility. Drawing on the information management literature, this research program attempts to propose an integrative information management framework to study the achievement of customer agility. Subsequently, a process model of how information management helps firms achieve customer agility will be developed. This is achieved by conducting a case study of a Chinese B2C company. This research in progress article presents the preliminary findings from the first visit to the company. It shows that customer agility is achieved through establishing information management structure, developing information management capability and instilling information behaviors and values. More interviews will be conducted in the next phase and the findings will be expanded.

The results are based on a survey sample of 302 participants. PLS-SEM is employed in the data analysis. Results reveal that trust is a crucial factor of consumer’s intention to adopt mobile payment. Results highlight that characteristics of the mobile service provider, mobile payment vendor and mobile technology influence the development of trust on mobile payment. In particular, consumer’s perceptions of structural assurance and environmental risks of mobile technology have strong influence on mobile payment trust. Results also highlight that consumers’ perceived reputation of the mobile service provider and mobile payment vendor positively relate to mobile payment trust.

%X Online brand communities, enabled by social media technology, are being utilized by companies to improve marketing and sales. However, little is known about how to encourage customer interactions in an online brand community and whether the interactions can affect purchase behavior. To address these research questions, we explore factors that influence the formation of social interactions in an online brand community and assess the impact of different types of social interactions on customer purchase behavior, resulting in a set of theoretical hypotheses about social interactions for e- commerce. We test our hypotheses using a data set that includes customer social interactions and purchases in an online brand community. Our results show that homophily in certain customer characteristics (e.g,. member age, location, deal sensitivity) positively impacts the formation of social interaction while homophily in other customer characteristics (e.g,. share premium products) does not. We also find that social interactions with people who have purchased strongly influence customer purchase behavior. Furthermore, the effect of such social interactions is strengthened by geographical proximity. We discuss theoretical implications of our results and also offer practical guidelines for managers on how to manage customer relationships in online brand communities.

%X Given the increasing importance of mobile applications in people’s daily life and the unique characteristics of mobile environment, surprisingly little research has been conducted to investigate consumers’ downloading behavior in mobile application stores. In this study, by combining predictors of product performance with customer value framework, we consider both text and non-text information in examining the effect of in-store information on application downloads. We apply latent semantic analysis technique to find out the meaningful, valuable information embedded in customer review and product description for five types of applications. We also find that for different types of applications, customers value information at various levels when they make downloading decisions. This study makes contributions by revealing the role of in-store information in mobile application downloads and providing application developers with useful guidance to improve information management in mobile application stores.

%X Recent advancements in Information and Communication Technology lead to the development of affordable, novel, out of the ordinary, and unconventional information technology artifacts. Such innovative technologies including virtual reality, wearable technology, and robots; feature unique human-computer interfaces, untraditional hardware designs, enable unique and atypical affordances, and provide their users with unprecedented experiences. As these artifacts become more pervasive, it is important to understand whether established Information Systems theories apply to this new paradigm. This meta-analysis introduces the definition of technology conventionality and investigates its moderating role on the effect of perceived enjoyment on users’ behavioural intention to use the technology with the aim of contrasting the effect sizes across conventional and unconventional technologies. Findings indicate that perceived enjoyment plays an important role in shaping users’ behavioural intention for both conventional and unconventional technologies. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.

%X Service innovations, enabled by the confluence of big data, mobile solutions, cloud, social, and cognitive computing, and the Internet of Things, have gained a lot of attention among many enterprises in the past few years because they represent promising ways for companies to effectively and rapidly deliver new services. But one of today's most pervasive and bedeviling challenges is how to start this journey and stay on course. In this paper, we review some of the important developments in this area and reports the views voiced by five industry leaders from IBM, Cisco, HP, and ISSIP at a panel session at the 24th Annual Compete through Service Symposium in 2013. Panelists provided an extensive list of recommendations to academicians and professionals. The biggest conclusion is that all of the information and communications technology (ICT)-enabled service innovations need to be human-centered and focused on co-creating value.

%X Little work in IT trust has extended the source credibility model from mass communications to the context of online media. Existing constructs arise from reference discipline concepts of interpersonal trust, but consumers view the Internet differently than they view individuals. We develop an Internet Source Credibility model that compares the effects of Trusting Intentions and Cosmetic Credibility on Purchase Intentions for an Internet security application provided by an Internet Service Provider. Results indicate that aspects of Internet Source Credibility are conceptually different from constructs demonstrated in both prior IS research and mass communications research. We find that the popular operationalization of trusting dispositions of buyers for the Internet medium is conceptually different from the popular IS operationalization of trust drawn from interpersonal buyer-seller interaction research. We also determine that characteristics of Internet sites are more predictive of subsequent purchase intentions than are user trusting intentions.

%X Live streaming, a new form of social media, is growing explosively due to its real-time interaction and new monetization model. Considering its popularity and unique features, it is important to gain a theoretical understanding of live streaming. Yet limited attention has been paid to it. This research investigates what factors may affect people’s consumption intention of virtual gifts in live streaming from contextual and personal dimensions. Based on flow theory, this study also explores the mediating role of flow and the moderating role of gender. The theoretical framework is tested using Structural Equation Modeling based on survey data collected in China. The study contributes to flow theory by highlighting the importance of flow in mediating the effects of interactivity, social presence, curiosity and social media dependence on consumption intention of virtual gifts. It also reveals gender differences in the influence of flow on consumption intention of virtual gifts.

%X The rapid diffusion of information and mobile technologies has revolutionized the way we do business and how we conduct our daily lives. Electronic commerce (e-commerce or EC) has had an enormous impact on business practices and has become a new area of study for researchers in related fields. Thousands of papers on this subject have been published in the past two decades, most of which have been published in e-commerce (EC) journals. However, many such papers have been published in information systems (IS) journals. Information systems have become the core discipline that drives e-commerce research. The purpose of this research is to report on the profiles of e-commerce papers published in major EC and IS journals, and to determine whether papers that have appeared in EC journals differ from those published in IS journals. We surveyed EC papers published in ten major journals and conducted a bibliometric analysis. Our findings indicate that (1) more EC papers are published in EC journals, but papers published in IS journals are cited more often; (2) collectively, authors in the U.S. are the most prolific, followed by those in China and Taiwan; (3) more theories were used in recent papers than in earlier ones, and the TAM has been the most popular model; (4) B2C and consumer behavior have been the most popular subject areas for EC research; and (5) the core knowledge measured by the co-citation network was provided by the same group of authors in EC and IS journal publications.

%X Customer engagement and share-of-wallet (SOW) are relatively new in the marketing literature, and academic research has only limitedly examined these concepts. This study presents five motivational drivers of customer brand engagement in social media and examines the nature of the relationship between these drivers and engagement. The moderation effect of consumer innovativeness on the relationship between engagement and SOW is also examined. Results suggest that community exerts the strongest positive effect on customer brand engagement and that such engagement positively influences SOW. The findings also indicate that consumer innovativeness strengthens the relationship between engagement and SOW. The findings also show that frequency of visits on the brand community site predict higher SOW. This study contributes to the understanding of customer brand engagement by describing how online brand community engagement and its antecedents drive SOW.

%X To bridge the research gap on the issue of metacognition in the IS research, this study examines consumer’s metacognition in the context of B2C e-commerce. Especially, focusing on the e-commerce solution in terms of Electronic Product Catalogs (EPCs), this study attempts to investigate the effect of the IT artefact on consumer’s metacognition in online shopping. From the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, the study combines neurophysiological methodology with psychometric measures to develop a deeper understanding of consumer’s metacognition. The fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is introduced to capture consumer’s neural activities in the region of interest (ROI) related to metacognition across the conditions of e-commerce websites with and without EPCs in a manipulated online shopping scenario. Besides, consumer’s evaluation of the e-commerce websites is further studied.

%X We examine an emerging user self-regulated business model that is nowadays very popular in China – WeChat C2C Commerce, where users sell commercial products to their colleagues, friends, and acquaintances through the Moment feeds in the mobile social networking application. Theories such as trust and swift Guanxi characterizing traditional seller-buyer dyads may not effectively explain the popularity of WeChat C2C commerce. Therefore, we approach this C2C model through the indigenous philosophy of Chinese. In particular, we examine how expressive and instrumental ties embedded in WeChat will substitute for and/or complement to the straightforward impacts of perceived value of products on buyers’ purchase intentions and behaviors. Our findings will not only contribute to IS theories on e-commerce, but also provide provocative insights for entrepreneurs and managers penetrating markets with collectivism culture.

%X Paid online healthcare is becoming pervasive among physicians and patients alike especially in developing countries such as China and India. However, there is little research about what influences the number of sales an online physician receives. This paper examines the effect of trust and price on online sales performance for patients with high mortality rate (high-risk) and low mortality rate (low-risk) diseases. Using logarithmic linear regression modeling, we analyze the data of 2,355 physicians from 457 hospitals in a Chinese online healthcare service platform. The result of this study show that the number of a physician’s orders is positively associated with price as well as their trustworthiness reflected by ability, reputation and benevolence. Our study contributes to the existing theories of trust and price-perceived quality relationships, as well as provides a guideline to help online healthcare practitioners to effectively improve their sales performance.

%X Based on big data, decisions can increasingly be drawn from data-driven analytics and algorithmic decision support. However, it remains unclear whether recommendations issued by computer algorithms are equally accepted by individuals as human advices. This is particularly intriguing given that big data entails various forms of ambiguous decision situations in which individuals cannot assess the underlying database or possible consequences. We conceptually introduce ambiguity in the light of big data and conduct an experiment to identify whether individuals prefer algorithmic to human recommendations and how outcome and data ambiguity affect individuals’ adoption behavior of algorithmic decision support. We find a preference for human recommendations, independently from the level of inherent ambiguity. However, areas that are more data-driven have a higher potential to overcome resistance to algorithmic decision support. Our results imply that developers of algorithmic decision support should provide high levels of transparency in areas which currently lack support.

%X The importance of customer behavior has grown exponentially in the past decade. The level of time and money that organizations are willing to invest explains the impact of customers’ perceptions toward an (e-commerce) business. In this paper, we have analyzed different models used to explain customers’ adoption behavior and its implications for e-commerce. There are numerous researches which were conducted on understanding the customer acceptance towards technology. We have studied these models and have created a consolidated report about customer acceptance and various constructs which potentially impact the customers’ behavior in an e-commerce business. We have seen the significant growth in the effort that was made towards this topic and concluded that the customer behavior analysis is a continuous process which every organization must adapt to.

%X The proliferation of the ICT ,smart phone, mobile technologies and other devices such as tab, note pad has encourage the users, financial organization and banks to use more m-banking services than before. The adoption of ICT varies on country to country according to the nature or characteristics of the people. And now a days, m-banking is considered to be an inseparable factor for financial firms for developing and developed country.  Since the prior studies has limited focus on cultural dimensions and very few study considered the importance of website quality on m-banking adoption .Therefore, we proposed a model in this study that extended the original UTAUT2 model with cultural dimensions and website quality to know the influences on the m-banking services adoption of Bangladeshi consumer. As a developing country like Bangladesh m-banking services adoption can play an important role and also motivate people to use m-banking services. This paper analyzed by applied partial least squares (PLS) with 220 samples. The study found that performance expectancy, facilitating condition and price value influences on behaviour intention but effort expectancy had no influence on m-banking adoption in this research. This study also revealed that power distance had influence on m-banking adoption and masculinity and uncertainty avoidance had no influence on behavioral intention to adopt m-banking services. The paper  offers  valuable  insights  to  decision-makers  involved  in  the  implementation  and  deployment  of  m-Banking  services. Moreover, the results endorse the relative significance of websites quality and culture to the adoption of m-banking services adoption. It will help the banking sectors to regulate their strategies and future plans to advance successful adoption and diffusion of m-banking services in Bangladesh.

%X Two critical problems of online customer reviews is the caused information asymmetry and information overload. To reveal consumers’ information processing under this circumstance, this paper proposes a model to investigate pleasure versus displeasure embedded in reviews as a potential signal of product quality and the moderating effects of perceived empathy and perceived cognitive effort based on the signaling theory. A laboratory experiment with 120 subjects was used to empirically test the research hypotheses. The results show that pleasure and displeasure embedded in reviews influence perceived product quality, which subsequently affects purchase decisions. Additionally, pleasant online reviews were found to have a greater influence on perceived product quality compared to unpleasant online reviews when the perceived empathy and perceived cognitive effort are higher. The findings demonstrate positive effects of pleasant online customer reviews, and provide important practical implications for both sellers and consumers.

%X Virtual QR Code Stores are currently expanding globally and it is commonplace in the market to put emphasis on purely hedonic product assortments. This practice reflects the widespread assumption that hedonic products should be more effective to stimulate purchases because they facilitate impulse buying behavior. Contrary to this argumentation, the results of our study demonstrate that purchasing related to Virtual QR Code Stores can better be explained by planned as opposed to impulse buying behavior. We show that more diverse product assortments consisting of utilitarian products in addition to hedonics are more effective to stimulate customers’ purchases in Virtual QR Code Stores. This is because utilitarian products cause improvements in customers’ utility perceptions of Virtual QR Code Stores resulting from enhanced shopping convenience. Based on this, we contribute by expanding the perspective on critical factors influencing customers in their purchase decision making process in Virtual QR Code Stores.

In particular, we conduct an econometric analysis examining how the characteristics of the users and their social networks affect their decision to participate in this novel service. Based on the empirical results, we find that the social neighbors of the users and their economic behavior, the brand loyalty of the users, and their familiarity with the platform have significant effects on the likelihood of social purchases. Additionally, we build predictive models in order to both identify the effective disseminators of information and discover their distinguishing characteristics. Finally, we both contribute to the related literature, discovering new rich findings, and provide actionable insights with major implications for brands and marketers who would like to generate direct sales on social network platforms and orchestrate word-of-mouth.

This research in progress develops a theoretical model that incorporates both actual disclosure behavior and the potential for irrational behavior induced by overriding situational factors presented at the time of the privacy disclosure decision. Actual disclosure behavior is seldom measured in privacy research, and most prior work has assumed the disclosure decision to be a fully rational one. This research challenges that assumption, and the eventual completion of the project will contribute uniquely to our understanding of the privacy calculus in online transactions.

%X In the era of Fintech innovation and e-commerce, faster settlement of massive retail transactions is crucial for business growth and financial system stability. However, speeding up payments settlement can create periodic liquidity shortfalls to banks which would incur high cost of funds in the settlement process. We propose a new hybrid settlement mechanism design that integrates features of real-time gross settlement, deferred net settlement, and central queue management structure. The hybrid mechanism is managed by an intermediary and is particularly suitable to settle large volume of small-value retail payments. We evaluate the mechanism using computer experiments and simulation. We find that central-queue netting is an effective means to achieve high system performance. Our results also show that the intermediary plays an important role in coordinating multilateral central-queue netting and supplying liquidity as needed to banks. We offer some policy insights into future faster payments settlement mechanism design and implementation.

%X In recent years new research studies have appeared that tackle the issue of smartphone adoption and acceptance, little is known about the consumer coproduction behaviour of smart phones. Many consumers dedicate to provide feedback to companies, help other consumers in solving problems, advocate and recommend of the product to other consumers; consequently, they are regarded as value co-producers. A better understanding of how the underlying mechanism facilitate consumer coproduction behaviour could be worthwhile to mobile marketing strategies. Our main goal is to understand what the driving factors in deterring consumer coproduction behaviours. This study proposes hedonic and symbolic value of smartphone drive consumer coproduction behaviours. Also, consumers with high innovativeness are more likely to engage in consumer coproduction behaviours. By using structural equation modelling (SEM), the result of this study shows that both symbolic and hedonic value of smartphone give rise to consumer coproduction behaviours through device attachment. The findings of this study also have implications to both marketers and researchers.

Viewing information quality, trust, and system quality as uncertainty reduction mechanisms, UA is hypothesized to moderate relationships involving these constructs in a recognized model of IS success. Using data drawn from over 3,500 actual consumers from 38 different countries, and controlling for the impact of other cultural dimensions, results suggest that UA moderates the effects of information quality on perceived usefulness, and of trust on e-loyalty, but not system quality relationships. The moderating effect of UA on the information quality-satisfaction relationship was non-significant, indicating uncertainty reduction effects may operate via a cognitive rather than an affective route. We close with implications.

%X The growing success of social media led to a strong presence of social information such as customer product reviews and product ratings in electronic markets. While this information helps consumers to better assess the quality of goods before purchase, its impact on consumer decision-making also incentivizes sellers to game the system by creating fake data in favor of specific goods in order to deliberately mislead consumers. As a consequence, consumers could make suboptimal choices or could choose to disregard social information altogether. In this exploratory study, we assess the effects non-genuine social information has on the consumer’s decision-making in the context of reward-based crowdfunding. Specifically, we capture unnatural peaks in the number of Facebook Likes that a specific crowdfunding campaign receives on the platforms Kickstarter and Indiegogo and observe subsequent campaign performance. Our results show that fake Facebook Likes have a very short-term positive effect on the number of backers participating in the respective crowdfunding campaign. However, this peak in participation is then followed by a period in which participation is lower than prior to the existence of the non-genuine social information. We further discuss circumstances that foster this artificial manipulation of quality signals.

%X Digital service providers frequently undergo independent third party assessments (i.e., IT certifications) to signal a high degree of service security and privacy. However, the academic literature presents a pattern of inconsistent findings with regard to certification effectiveness. As prior research only analyzes the impact of certifications from a black box perspective (i.e., embedded vs. not embedded a certification seal), we currently lack a deep understanding about certification effectiveness. We ground our study on signaling theory to open up the black box and explain what factors influence certification effectiveness. With this short paper, we provide an overview of constructs that influence signal effectiveness derived from related literature on signaling theory. As part of our ongoing work, we will evaluate whether these findings based on the signaling theory can be applied to certifications by conducting interviews with consumers of digital services to derive a detailed theoretical model about certification effectiveness.

%X Although perceived risk and usefulness have been identified as two major factors that influence the acceptance of an innovative mobile payment, relatively few researchers have explored the impact of affective factors on user-perceived risk and usefulness. We also do not know whether there is a difference in the acceptance intention among users across different diffusion stages of this innovation. This paper aims to investigate: (1) the relative effects of cognitive (perceived risk and perceived usefulness) and affective (positive emotion) factors on acceptance intention, (2) the role of positive emotion in decreasing perceived risk and increasing perceived usefulness, and (3) the moderating effects of diffusion stages (introduction vs. growth) on the relationships between these three determinants and users’ intentions to accept a WeChat payment, an innovative mobile payment that has various usage scenarios in China. Empirical analysis on two datasets show that users’ acceptance intention is relatively related to perceived risk, perceived usefulness, and positive emotion. Positive emotion has a strong negative impact on perceived risk and a positive impact on perceived usefulness. More importantly, multi-group analyses find that both positive emotion and perceived risk have significant positive and negative impacts on acceptance intention at the stage of market introduction rather than market growth. Rather, the influence of positive usefulness on acceptance intention is significantly higher at the stage of market growth than at market introduction. The findings of this study indicate that exploring the moderating effect of diffusion stages in mobile payment acceptance provides a more comprehensive understanding of how to achieve a greater acceptance rate of an emerging or innovative mobile payment service.

%X Currently, the majority of Chinese online consumers paid more attention to price and service quality. This paper studied the Price and Service competition in E-commerce of China. A price game within two online business companies is used in this paper. This study shows that the product’s utility to a customer has a great influence on decision making of the two online business companies. As the product’s utility to a customer varies, the two companies may compete or not. This paper will help US companies to get some knowledge about China Market and to avoid failures.

%X Online paid knowledge(OPK) has become very popular since online knowledge platforms have been undergoing a tremendous transformation from providing online free knowledge to OPK. Trust is vital because knowledge is subjective and OPK requires consumers to invest money, time and effort. This study focuses on factors that drive consumers’ trust since OPK creates a new revenue source for both knowledge platforms and knowledge providers. Drawing on customer value theory, we propose that consumers’ perceptions of customer value influence trust. We examine six value relevant factors extracted from three dimensions of customer value: functional (knowledge quality and price utility), emotional (perceived enjoyment and anxiety relief), and social value (social knowledge-image expression and social relationship support). Survey data was analyzed and hypotheses were tested with structural equation modeling(SEM). The results indicate that functional, emotional, and social value contribute significantly to trust. The findings and implications are discussed.

%X With the rapid development of social Web and electronic commerce, the potential consumers seek for product-related information before making a purchase decision from various online resources. Among all kinds of online resources, customer review provides critical product features that general consumers might care the most about their opinions. The discussion boards play another vital role for peer communication online to share the user-generated content. The social network generated in the discussion boards are not only the relationship among the users led by their behaviour’s in the community but also the interpretational information. With the rich online resources, consumers easily to get ideas about their purchase decisions. However, there is a lack of integration of these rich online resources that cause consumers overwhelmed by information. This study particularly investigates customer review and social network and explores how two social resources associated with each other to improve the insight into each user’s preference with a social role they act. By tracking hidden trends on posts and capturing consumers’ preference altogether, this study can guide and recommend marketing practitioners to launch the advertising campaigns and make use of the dissatisfied comments on specific product feature. Meanwhile, the product designer can gain some insights to modify the functionality of a product or a service.

%X In this paper, we empirically investigate the value of live chatting tools on purchase. We use a clickstream data from a leading online marketplace where live chats between e-tailers and customers are documented. We follow the classic two-stage choice model proposed by Moe (2006), and incorporate the choice of chatting as a new stage. In our model, consumers make a sequence of three stages of choices. In the first stage, they choose a product to view; In the second stage, they decide on whether to initiate a live chat; In the third stage, they decide on whether to purchase. This process iterate until consumers decide to stop. We find that consumers choose products with low price and high reputation in the first stage. They request live chat when e-tellers' reputation is low and the price is low. Finally, live chat has positive impact over purchase, especially for low-reputation e-tailers.

%X Recommender Systems have obvious influence in environments where data size exceeds the capabilities of any user to fully explore the available choices in the store (physical or on-line). Many algorithms and techniques have been used to help recommending useful and interesting items to users. If the user is unidentified, the process is even harder as there are no historical or other data to use as input. Association rules is a popular technique used for many purposes in Recommender Systems such as for building more robust systems, improving quality of recommendations; and even addressing fundamental limitations of recommender systems and, generally, large datasets, e.g. sparsity and cold start. At the same time, efforts have been made to fully understand if and how differently customers are behaving in an online and in a physical environment.This work tries to combine the two efforts. We use association rules to provide recommendations to customers, as well as understand who the customer is, what her needs are and what is her mentality when entering a physical store or the corresponding e-shop. To fulfill our goal, we used descriptive statistics along with Association Rules analysis of the POS transactional data on basket data level and historical data level.

%X With the population of social networking services (SNS) like WeChat, they have emerged as an increasingly important media or platform that facilitates product-focused electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) activities. Meanwhile, e-commerce has become an essential part of our daily life. The goal of the current research is to discover the key factors that affect consumers’ willingness to engage in eWOM behaviors on mobile social media like WeChat. We mainly investigate eight factors including personal factors, WeChat usage, social communication, e-commerce participation, consumer online perceptions, perceived risk, platform factors, and product factors, which may encourage or restrain consumers to spread eWOM on WeChat. We have constructed a theoretic model and proposed a series of hypotheses. In order to verify the model as well as the hypotheses, we have carried out a questionnaire survey. Moreover, we use SPSS 20 software to analyze the results of the survey. We try to find out the significant factors that affect eWOM most on WeChat. According to the result, social communications and consumer online perceptions have shown strong influence on eWOM. Finally we make a discussion on the results, which could be used to support the marketing or sales activities of potential enterprises.

%X Over the last decades, personal data has become a crucial asset for digital services. The exploitation of this asset, however, entails severe threats to privacy. Recently, so-called Privacy Dashboards have been presented, which are tools that allow users to gain insight and exercise control over data that a digital service provider has accumulated about them. This innovation enables not only privacy protection but also new ways of collaboration of users and providers of digital services. Privacy Dashboards have the potential to allow users to participate in the generation of user profiles for personalized services, thereby contributing to improved services. However, while a variety of Privacy Dashboards has been presented, factors leading to their actual adoption by users are largely unexplored. To fill this research gap, this paper provides an empirical analysis of antecedents of users’ adoption of Privacy Dashboards, in that focusing in particular on the currently most-prominent Privacy Dashboard “Google My Account”. Integrating the Technology Acceptance Model and the Privacy Calculus, our analysis shows that trust is the crucial factor in users’ adoption of the examined Privacy Dashboard and that Privacy Dashboards can both support users in protecting their privacy but also induce them to disclose personal data and thereby contribute to more precise user profiles.

%X Zoorate emerged from its cofounders’ ambition to develop a Web portal for aggregating product reviews. The company’s core product, Feedaty, had evolved from a platform that matched reviewers by affinity into a full-fledged platform for aggregating and certifying consumer feedback. Specifically targeting online sellers and merchants, Zoorate continually increased its client based and signed up more than 1,000 customers by 2017. Supported by the strategic partnership and synergies with its shareholder 7Pixel Srl, the firm appeared to have finally set sail for success. However, several challenges lay ahead. The main competitors continued to grow in strength internationally and increasingly challenged Feedaty’s value proposition. How should Zoorate efficiently grow Feedaty? How should it deal with strong international competition that had begun to gain traction in Italy? Should the company continue to consolidate its Italian presence or expand abroad? The answer to these difficult questions would ultimately determine Zoorate’s future.

%X Product returns are typically seen as a necessary headache and a cost drain for e- marketplace sellers. Although previous studies have explored the influences of web technologies on product returns, little is known about the mechanisms under which different categories of web technologies work. More importantly, extant studies on page views suggest a conflict relationship between product page views and product returns and attribute it to the moderating influences of information technology- enabled systems, but few studies have considered distinguishing the home page views and product page views. In this study, we developed a research model that incorporates both the differential influences of pricing vs. product oriented web technologies on home page views vs. product page views and the mediating role of page views in the relationship between web technologies and product returns by drawing on elaboration likelihood model and expectation confirmation theory. We plan to validate it by using a unique longitudinal dataset of observations of 4,000 sellers over ten months in the biggest e-marketplace in China. The research and practice implications are discussed.

%X We investigate the impact of several recommender algorithms (e.g., Amazon.com's “Consumers who bought this item also bought”), commonly implemented in e-commerce, on sales volume and diversity using a field experiment on a top retailer website. Sales volume refers to the number of products purchased while sales diversity refers to the market share distribution of purchased products. For sales volume, we show that different algorithms have differential impacts with a widely used algorithm having no impacts. For sales diversity, we find that collaborative filtering in particular cause individuals to discover and purchase more variety of products but push each individual to the same set of popular titles, leading to concentration bias at the aggregate level. Managerially, our results inform personalization and recommendation strategy in e-commerce. Academically, this paper adds to the emerging but controversial topic of the impact of recommenders on sales volume and diversity for several algorithms with field experiment

%X Online group buying, as a new form of e-commerce, has offered customers a great deal of promotion and convenience in shopping. Meanwhile, there are an increasing number of OGB vendors struggling in the fierce competition and extremely turbulent business environment. During 2010 and 2011, more than 2000 OGB vendors in China have been out of business or facing with bankruptcy. Therefore, study of search and purchase behavior of potential customers in online group buying is meaningful to OGB vendors. This stream of study can offer information in relating how to maintain and improve competitiveness in the market. Present study aims to conduct an empirical research on the impact on customers’ search and purchase intention in online group buying. Since little prior research has investigated the searching and purchase behavior in the context of online group buying, this research tends to fill this void by examine multiple antecedents, including products measures, vendor-related factors and individual characteristics. This paper also provides informative knowledge and contributions to both academic researchers and business practitioners.

%X This study investigates gender differences issue regarding the effect of platform characteristics on trust and continuance intention in the context of mobile payment. Drawing upon innovation diffusion and trust theory, a research model is developed to examine four significant antecedents of trust for male and female users. An empirical survey was conducted and 740 valid questionnaires were collected from users of Alipay and Wechat pay, which are recognized as two leading mobile payment platforms in China. Structural equation modelling analysis results suggest that security is the most significant antecedent of customers’ trust, followed by platform reputation, mobility and customization. Specifically, a multi-group analysis results indicate that mobility and reputation have more significant influence on trust for males, while customization and security are more important in promoting trust for females. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the final section.

%X With the rise of tablets and smartphones, online shopping is increasingly occurring on “direct-touch” computer interfaces. Work is needed to investigate whether and how the different interfaces affect consumers’ psychological reaction to products. This research attempts to examine how sense of touch elicited by touch versus non-touch computer interfaces influences the ways online consumers construe products. Drawing on the literature on mental simulation and construal level, we propose that high sense of touch could result in a concrete mental product construal by decreasing the perceived psychological distance of products; accordingly, touch interfaces can shift consumers’ attentions to product feasibility considerations, whereas non-touch interfaces shift consumers’ attentions to product desirability considerations. Two lab experiments are designed to test these effects. Potential theoretical contributions, practical implications, and future research are discussed.

%X With the popularity of social networking, consumer often relies on social network when making purchase decisions. Social commerce in this regard represents a shift in consumers’ behavior from individual-based user generated content (UGC) to collaborative generated content (CGC), such as tags, Danmu. For consumers, from one side, they can get additional information from CGC; from the other side, they can participate into CGC to recreate the original content and satisfy their intrinsic needs. Does CGC of original content cause a person to view the recreated content more favorably? Will this fond of recreated content lead to economic benefits? Thus motivated, we use the construal level theory, and explore the effects by examining whether CGC might cause consumer’s willingness to pay. CGC will be analyzed by using Language Act Perspective-based Analysis. The study will contribute to research by adding to our understanding of a new aspect of consumer’s purchase behavior in social commerce, i.e. CGC through social network. It also lends insights on how product vendors can offer such service to tap this source of revenue.

%X Reddit is a social news website that aims to provide user privacy by encouraging them to use pseudonyms and refraining from any kind of personal data collection. However, users are often not aware of possibilities to indirectly gather a lot of information about them by analyzing their contributions and behaviour on this site. In order to investigate the feasibility of large-scale user classification with respect to the attributes social gender and citizenship this article provides and evaluates several data mining techniques. First, a large text corpus is collected from Reddit and annotations are derived using lexical rules. Then, a discriminative approach on classification using support vector machines is undertaken and extended by using topics generated by a latent Dirichlet allocation as features. Based on supervised latent Dirichlet allocation, a new generative model is drafted and implemented that captures Reddit’s specific structure of organizing information exchange. Finally, the presented techniques for user classification are evaluated and compared in terms of classification performance as well as time efficiency. Our results indicate that large-scale user classification on Reddit is feasible, which may raise privacy concerns among its community.

%X Efficient last-mile distribution of fresh fruits and vegetables is a major challenge within e-grocery operations. This work presents a decision support system to jointly investigate the impact of various service offers on customer preferences and logistics operations. Results from a conjoint analysis surveying 531 end consumer are incorporated within an agent-based simulation. Delivery days, fees, time windows and discounts as well as guaranteed remaining shelf life of products at delivery are considered. To model shelf life and schedule deliveries, food quality models and vehicle routing procedures are further integrated within the system. Based on an e-grocery provider operating in Vienna, Austria, computational experiments investigate the impact of the offered delivery service on fulfilled demand, order volume and customer utility. Results indicate the importance of incorporating shelf life data within e-grocery operations and various potentials of considering customer preferences in logistics decision support systems.

%X The strategy and marketing literature on barriers to entry identifies a range of general factors that protect incumbents but most of this work pre-dates the use of the Internet channel. The Internet is generally considered to make markets more open and competitive. However, the Internet strategy theory does not take into account the nature of the consumer search process. A new online market strategy model is proposed that synthesizes elements of the strategy, marketing and technology literatures and relates market entry strategy with the online consumer search process. The framework is illustrated with original, empirical case evidence from a range of international markets in Europe and the US. Five distinctive strategies are identified: (1) the online launch effect; (2) open web partnerships; (3) build alliance with incumbent; (4) multi-brand attack; and (5) exploit technology shift. It is argued that Internet marketing strategy should be integrated into the marketing function in order to achieve successful implementation.

%X Product attributes are closely related to consumers' willingness to buy on e-commerce. Some products are considered that few people would buy them online, but in fact they have large sales volume, such as underwear products. This study analyzed from the perspective of the product grey private information of why consumers buy and who is buying these products, what kind of relationship between the purchasing comments and product attributes of these products. Firstly, we select the companies with certain influence to the exploratory research to study the company's comments, and do the data mining of the top 10 products of the best sales and the last 10 products of the poor sales. Secondly, we analyzed the product attributes of the 14 enterprises again by the iterative method and compared with the first exploration result. Thirdly, we studied on the value of common knowledge and outlier knowledge for these products. The study found that common knowledge has the sensitive interval for the price of grey private products, the product price, the discount of the product and the sales volume of the product have significant relationship. The discovery of outlier knowledge is open and the comfort is very different. There is a significant positive correlation between the time of marketing and the sales volume: simple, natural, health products and sales are related; the extreme situations are not universal, but have good room for growth.

%X User generated content (UGC) is an important source of information to consumers, yet prior  research has not fully explored how certain aspects of  the content, specifically the tone, perception of quality and source credibility influence attitudes and intentions to buy. This study investigates how the tone of UGC influences perceived content quality, source credibility, attitudes and consumer intentions to buy. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, the study also seeks to understand how consumer expertise moderates the impact of perceived content quality and perceived source credibility on attitudes and intentions to buy. Using a survey and vignette with 209 participants, the results of the study indicate that the tone of the content influences attitudes and intentions to buy; more importantly, consumer expertise moderates the impact of perceived source credibility and perceived content quality on attitudes. The results inform practice on what dimensions of UGC are salient to changes in attitudes.

%X Based on UTAUT2 and the importance of trust to explain user behavior in relation to recommender systems, we focus on job recommender systems by developing and validating a job recommender system acceptance model. The results of our empirical, survey-based study with 440 job seekers indicate that beside performance expectancy and habit, trust is among the three most important determinants and it is especially relevant for women, passive job seekers and those without experience in using job recommender systems. The paper extends general trust and recommender system research by revealing three moderators for the trust and intention relationship. It contextualizes the UTAUT2 by incorporating trust as an antecedent of a consumer’s intention to use and by revealing three moderating effects for this relationship. Hence, it is the basis for further studies investigating the acceptance of job recommender system, which has rather been neglected by prior research.

%X Decision-making behavior is heterogeneous. We therefore suggest building a decision support system for online purchase decisions that can support various different decision strategies and also allows users to mix them. We design this minimally restrictive system by decomposing different strategies into their component steps and implementing aids for supporting these steps. We empirically compare this system to a typical one, which restricts the users by supporting only one normative, utility-maximizing strategy. Users perceive the minimally restrictive system as requiring lesser effort and being more enjoyable to use than the typical decision support system. Furthermore, they exhibit a higher intention to re-use the minimally restrictive system. However, there is no difference with respect to the perceived usefulness. Our results imply that webstores should implement minimally restrictive systems not only because of high user satisfaction, but also because analyzing clicks on the aids provides information as to which strategies are being used.

%X The IS continuance model has been extensively applied in past studies for investigating continued information system (IS) usage behavior. The current study attempts to extend the post-adoption beliefs in the IS continuance model based on effort-accuracy model, by extending the application of IS continuance model beyond an instrumental focus. The extended IS continuance model, incorporating the post-adoption beliefs of perceived usefulness, perceived decision quality, and perceived decision effort, was empirically validated with data collected from an online survey of 626 existing users of online product recommendations (OPRs). The data analysis revealed that the extended IS continuance has good explanatory power (R2 = 62.1% of continued OPRs use intention, R2 = 53% of satisfaction, R2 = 50.5% of perceived usefulness, and R2 = 9% of perceived decision effort, and R2 = 72.3% of perceived decision quality), with all major paths supported except two. We also analysed the data on the original IS continuance model. The higher variances explained for the extended IS continuance model (D6% in continued OPRs use intention, D5.1% in customer satisfaction, and D3.2% in perceived usefulness). Hence, the extended IS continuance model can provide additional information that is relevant for understanding continued IS use. The significant effects of post-adoption perceived decision quality signify that the nature of the IS can be an important boundary condition in understanding the continued IS usage behavior. At a practical level, the extended IS continuance model presents IS product/service providers with deeper insights into how to address IS users’ satisfaction and continued patronage.

%X Given its interesting history, dating back to the 18th century, crowdfunding is being recognised as a potential key driver of social impact in the 21st century. However, what we have seen is that even the philanthropic/social-benefit focus may not be sufficient to ensure success. In fact, many projects on crowdfunding platforms fail to persuade enough people to contribute financially. This study seeks to understand how persuasiveness may be enhanced in the digital entrepreneurial crowdfunding context. The adoption of the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model aided the development of a framework of distinct features deemed to facilitate persuasion. The proposed “Crowdfunding Platform Design” (CFPD) model is examined through a content analysis of five real-world crowdfunding platforms, resulting in the development of visual representations for each of the CFPD model’s features. The content analysis is then followed up by semi-structured interviews with users of real-world crowdfunding platforms. Given the potential of crowdfunding platforms to drive social impact and change, this research-in-progress seeks to provide a holistic framework to help facilitate persuasiveness and in turn the success of crowdfunding platforms.

%X Strategy researchers have long been concerned with the sources of competitive advantage, i.e., why some firms’ performance is superior over others. One argument to answer this question is provided by the dynamic capability view which posits that some firms are better at adapting to a changing business environment than others. This study scrutinizes online communities and their interplay with dynamic capabilities. We present evidence which shows that organizations may use online communities to sense and shape opportunities and threats, to seize opportunities, and to reconfigure the enterprise’s intangible and tangible assets, thus helping their host organizations adapt to a changing business environment. In doing so, the paper bridges the strategy and the information systems literature and provides novel empirical insights into the strategic use of information technology.

%X In the off-line world, capable sales representatives align their advisory approach with their customer´s individual profile to improve the quality of the process and the likelihood of a positive outcome for both parties. However, we see a movement away from the classical advisory settings towards “omni-channel” strategies, where companies serve their customers through a combination of on-line and off-line channels. In this short paper, we undertake a first investigation of how specific characteristics in the customer profile could affect the advisory success and introduce the "OPTI-model". We illustrate the application of our model using the example of Digital Investment Services, knowing that the financial services industry is one area where “omni-channel” strategies have become highly relevant.

%X Since van der Heijden (2004) it is widely accepted that hedonic and utilitarian information systems underlie different adoption mechanisms. Within this research, we compare two homogenous user groups and their adoption behaviors with respect to e-commerce websites. The groups thereby differ only in the fact that one of them consists of individuals suffering from mobility impairment. Consistent with theory in psychology and medical rehabilitation that suggests that disablement leads to an adapted evaluation of surroundings (including ICT) in terms of needs and purposes, we show by means of a multi-group structural equation analysis that concerning adoption determinants of a sys-tem, not only the mere system characteristics (utilitarian vs. hedonic) matter, but also the value that is attached to the system by the user in terms of his personal needs. The results indicate that although e-commerce websites are predominantly classified as hedonic system, the adoption of them by the mobil-ity-impaired group is predominantly determined by perceived usefulness. This leads to the discussion if user characteristics in terms of physical capabilities and the needs they imply should be attached more importance to in IS adoption research.

%X We adopt Media system dependency theory (MSD) to examine e-commerce and social media use in Cambodia. A field study was conducted by performing semi-structured interviews with three major e-commerce website owners: Little Fashion, Khmer24.com, and Comptech.com. Through the lens of MSD, we observe how these e-commerce websites were established by using a grass-root approach. Furthermore, we interview local business owners who are using social mediaâ€”Facebook and YouTubeâ€”as tools of marketing and customer services. We found that 1) e-commerce activities are fully depends on social media and that 2) from a media perspective Facebook plays the role of fulfilling userâ€™s needs of getting information and services and that 3) e-commerce activities are highly depend on big players such as Facebook and Google. We also found that the environment is yet mature for e-commerce activities but opportunities exist for business ventures. The social background of Cambodia is unique, as such, the online activities and social media use behavior is completely different from what is observed in western countries and we conclude few unintended consequences of social media use which go beyond the scope of our knowledge.

%X In recent years the emergence of Web 2.0has brought changes in businesses. It may be observed as a paradigm shift in business (Wigand, et al., 2008). It has affected e-commerce, resulting in the emergence of a new concept known as social commerce. This has also led to changes within many business plans in online markets. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) the author analyses some of the components of social commerce which affect the intention to buy among individuals by proposing and testing Social Commerce Adoption Model (SCAM). Most research undertaken in the area of social commerce has been descriptive and lacks a solid theoretical foundation. This research gathers survey data and applies structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse the data. Participation on forums and communities and perceived usefulness are shown to positively impact the trust, leading to more intention to buy among consumers.

This study extends theory of planned behavior (TPB) by including six important antecedents to online purchase intention. This study is conducted with a survey of 234 college students who have online shopping experiences. The collected survey data is used to test each hypothesis developed by using SPSS18 and AMOS18 in the research model. The results of data analysis confirm perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived risk, and trust are essential antecedents in determining online purchase intention through behavioral attitude and perceived behavioral control.

%X Product text snippets should highlight the product features that are appealing to customers. Nevertheless, the features in current product snippets mainly are often decided based on the understanding of vendors or advertisers, and may fail to contain the features appealing to customers. This paper investigates how product text snippets generation can benefit from online customer reviews. In doing so, an automated method is designed, in which features and the opinions are extracted from online reviews, and are further used for product text snippet generation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct two experiments and the results show that the extracted features and the snippet are effective in inviting potential customers, compared with the baseline ones. Experimental results demonstrate that 1) the extracted features are more appealing to customers; and 2) the snippets generated based on the extracted features are more likely to be clicked.

%X Smart home (SH) services promote the comfort, convenience, security, entertainment, healthcare, education and communication of people in their home environments. Despite radical enhancements envisioned to peoples’ lives, the SH market has remained a niche for more than three decades. Yet, recent fast-paced developments, including ubiquitous computing, miniaturization of microelectronic components and digitalization of societies, have spurred a new wave of interest in a field populated by various technology platforms battling for dominance. In this light, we explore the determinants for wide-spread adoption of SH platforms informed by 21 experts from 19 companies. Our qualitative content analysis identifies, classifies, ranks and describes 34 determinants and yields a theoretical model on SH platform adoption. As such, we provide a basis for further research on platform ecosystems and managerial implications on platform design and governance in the SH field. In particular, we highlight the technical and organizational openness and the legitimacy of sponsorship.

%X It has been well recognized that vendors’ reputation plays an important role in e-commerce. As a popular platform for promoting the services or products online, groupon websites have developed various reputation systems to assist the customers in making their purchase decisions. This paper performs an empirical study to investigate the impact of service reputation on the groupon buying behaviors using data from a major groupon website in China. A set of service reputation metrics is developed to measure the service reputation for different service providers, and the groupon buying behavior is measured by the amount of users participating in the corresponding collective buying activity. Correlation analysis is carried out to find out the relationship between the service reputation and the groupon purchase behaviors. Our research indicates the necessity for an improvement for the current service reputation systems of the groupon web sites.

We plan to use the mean-end chain approach to collect qualitative data. The objective of this research is to explore how various factors interact with situational factors to affect users’ decision of a mobile payment method usage.

%X Despite the widely recognized importance of continuous business model development for achieving product market fit, very little remains understood about efficient methods that may support this process in the context of nascent IT ventures. Contributions for supporting value proposition development, especially in the popular field of open innovation, have largely focused on well established firms and more traditional approaches such as the lead user method. More recent findings suggest novel ways of virtual user integration, like the collection of user feedback via promotional campaigns, which is particularly prevalent among IT startups. However, these contributions have remained conspicuously theoretical. Therefore, by drawing on an experimental study in the context of the artificially created online fashion startup StyleCrowd, we investigate the role of scarcity and personalization, two classical promotional cues that have become ubiquitous on the web yet have been overlooked by research, in enhancing the virality of nascent ventures’ online promotional campaigns to enhance user feedback. Our analysis reveals that while scarcity cues affect social sharing regardless of whether a campaign is personalized or not, personalization cues are particularly effective when scarcity is absent, yet are cancelled out when scarcity is prevalent. We discuss implications for research and practice.

%X In recent years, mobile commerce is developing rapidly because of the popularity of mobile devices. However, for the difficulty of the mobile device input, the users of the e-commerce websites usually don’t log on the website when they are browsing, which resulting in a situation that a large number of website visitors are anonymous users. In order to increase sales revenue and expand market share, an effective prediction of anonymous users’ purchases proneness is very helpful in providing targeted marketing strategy for website to induce anonymous users to purchase. In the past, customer segmentation was mainly analyzed and modeled by customers’ historical data. But the history data of anonymous users can’t be obtained on mobile commerce sites. This method is difficult to put into management practice. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method based on random forest of using user clickstream data to forecast purchase proneness in real time. This method includes two stages: the model training part and the user purchasing proneness prediction part. In the model training part, a classifier based on random forest algorithm is trained. In the users' predicting part, the classifier is used to predict the user's purchase proneness in real time. The method proposed can be effectively applied in the real-time prediction of anonymous users' purchasing proneness, and the results of prediction will help enterprises implement the marketing measures in real time.

%X Service e-Commerce (SeC) is emerging as a booming form of e-commerce where various services are contracted, managed, sold, and even delivered via the Internet. However, the uncertainty of service quality due to information asymmetry has been a major challenge to the development of SeC. Some SeC platforms tried to promote service business by lowering buyer’s perceived risk through the service guarantee mechanism. However, the mechanism seems not very successful to lift the low participation rate. This study investigated the effects of service guarantee on service e-marketplace by examining the case of zhubajie.com, a well-known service e-marketplace in China. A total of 30,406 providers (including 406 service-guarantee and 30,000 non-service-guarantee providers) were collected and analyzed. The analyses found that there are different modes for low-reputation and high-reputation service providers to participate in the service guarantee. In addition, results also show that service guarantee only improves business performance for the service providers with high reputation. For low-reputation service providers, the service guarantee mechanism does not have significant effects. Implications and suggestions were made to guide future practice and research in similar contexts.

%X Service recovery is a critical moment of truth in retaining customers and reinforcing customer relationships, and has been considered as an “Achilles' heel” in online marketplaces. Poor service recoveries exacerbate the negative effects of the failure, producing a “double deviation” effect. The double deviation effect may arise from the seller’s power misuse and then dissolve the buyer-seller relationship (e.g., violate consumer psychological contract), elicit consumer negative emotions which lead to customer coping behaviors. This study links the theories of psychological contract violation (PCV), emotion, and coping from the power perspective to investigate the double deviation scenario in online auction marketplaces. Two moderators (perceived power and perceived consumer empowerment) are considered in our proposed model. Data collected from 190 consumers of one auction website provide support for the proposed model. The results shed light on what constitutes the determinants of consumer judgments while facing double deviation scenario and how consumers react to and cope with it in online marketplaces. Finally, implications and limitations are discussed in the last part of this paper.

We compare consumers' browsing behaviors in the m-commerce channel against the traditional e-commerce channel. For the comparison, we offer an integrative web usage mining approach, combining visualization graphs, association rules and classification models to analyze the Web server log files of a large Internet retailer in Israel, who introduced m-commerce to its existing e-commerce offerings.  \  \ The analysis is expected to reveal typical m-commerce and e-commerce browsing behavior, in terms of session timing and intensity of use and in terms of session navigation patterns. The obtained results will contribute to the emerging research area of m-commerce and can be also used to guide future development of mobile websites and increase their effectiveness. Our preliminary findings are promising. They reveal that browsing behaviors in m-commerce and e-commerce are different.

%X Consumers are unclear about how to process and identify helpful information despite the fact that the popularization of the social network service (SNS) enhances the information acquisition of consumers and help them reduce uncertainties and risks in online shopping. With the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the online trust model as the theoretical underpinnings, we identify relevant factors and framework that influence the helpfulness of online consumer reviews (OCRs) in the SNS environment, that is, the accuracy, completeness, currency and format of information and the trustworthiness of reviewers. The analysis results of 221 samples through applying the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) indicate that the accuracy and completeness of information are the most influential factors. The currency has no significant influence on the helpfulness. This research extends the application of the OCR helpfulness in the SNS environment and therefore can be used as reference for enterprise’s online marketing.

%X Existing literature lacks a common taxonomy and systematic integration necessary for building cumulative knowledge on the nature of trust in an information systems context. Hence, this article explores online trust’s multidimensional nature within the context of online stores. This article develops a framework for classifying trust dimensions and to investigate their influences on behaviors in new and familiar business-to-consumer (B-to-C) e-commerce environments. Specifically, we classify trust dimensions into two levels: general trust (beliefs toward the general e-commerce environment and infrastructure) and specific trust (beliefs regarding a specific e-commerce shopping experience). Specific trust is further delineated into trust in the merchant and trust in the technology artifact, i.e., the website. The integrative framework was tested in two separate empirical studies using e-commerce stores that were either new or familiar to the subjects. The results show that general trust mechanisms are important to consumers in a new e-commerce environment. In contrast, when shopping in a familiar e-commerce store, consumers pay more attention to the current Web experience, diminishing the salience of general trust. This article contributes to the literature by developing an integrative framework of trust and by providing insights into the influences of trust dimensions on purchase decisions in new and familiar e-commerce environments.

%X Banks expect the mobile channel to become more important for collaborating with customers. However, a lack of trust continues to prevent a faster dissemination of such mobile banking services, especially for the private banking customer segment. Hence, this paper discusses various determinants of trust and follows a theory-driven approach rooted in the collaboration engineering methodology. Grounded in the calculativebased, relational-based and institution-based views of trust, we derive the following design requirements for collaboration processes on mobile banking platforms: security, privacy, transparency, familiarity, social presence and normality. By validating these requirements with expert interviews, we contribute to existing theory by adding transparency as a design requirement for a collaboration process that fosters trust. Moreover, contrary to existing theory, we did not confirm familiarity as a requirement in this study.

%X Monetizing their users’ personal information instead of charging a fee has become an established revenue model for platform operators—a new form of media companies specialized in aggregating, managing, and distributing user-generated online content. However, the commodification of privacy leads to privacy concerns that might be a risk for such businesses. Thus, a new approach is to focus on consumers’ willingness to pay for privacy, assuming that monetizing privacy protection might be an alternative revenue model. Following the freemium idea, we developed an innovative research design, offering 553 online survey participants the opportunity to subscribe to a fictional premium version of Facebook with additional privacy control features in return for a monthly fee. Based on the theory of planned behavior, we developed and tested a research model to explain actual willingness to pay for privacy behavior. Our findings show that perceived usefulness and trust significantly affect willingness to pay. In contrast, perceived internet privacy risk was not found to have a significant influence. We thus conclude that consumers are willing to pay for privacy in the form of a privacy-freemium model, provided they perceive the premium version as offering added value and as trustworthy.

%X Confronted with well-informed consumers, the firms have to take everything into consideration. Through the classic game theory, pricing mechanism is discussed with different characteristics of consumer behavior. The consumer population is heterogeneous along two dimensions: they may have an inclination towards the obedience of the public and different degrees of patience. After introducing the price deviation variables, we demonstrate that heterogeneity in both inclination and patience is important because they jointly determine the structure of optimal pricing policies. The numerical example shows that the markdown degree, the expected purchasing amount of consumers and the expected profits of the firm are increasing with the increase of the proportion of counter-conformity consumers. And we also examine whether the discount rate of capital, counter-conformity consumers and myopic consumers will have an impact on the sales. In particular, when the discount rate and the proportion of the conformity customers are too high, the expected profits of the firm are increasing mildly with the increase of the proportion of myopic customers. Therefore, the discount rate and characteristics of consumer behavior should be considered together to maximize the revenue of firms.

%X The explosive development of Web 2.0 and online word-of-mouth (WOM) communications have facilitated the transaction of experience goods from offline to online. However, most of the online WOM merely consist of words which make it hard to convey the subtle feelings and experiences of consuming such products or services. In order to form more precise perceptions and reduce uncertainty, search engines are commonly used by individuals to reach more concrete product-related information. Prior studies proposed that consumers' online information search behavior reflects their specific intentions and correlates with further economic activities. However, there is still a deficiency of empirical evidence that identifies the possible impacts of consumers' information search behavior on purchasing decisions for experience goods. In cognition of this research gap, this paper conduct an empirical analysis to investigate the relationship between consumers' hotel information search behavior on Google.com and hotel booking data on Expedia.com. The results show that larger volume of search queries for one hotel is associated with higher room booking rate from the online travel agent. Furthermore, the interaction between information search and hotel review indicates that information search on Google weakens the reliance of online WOM on purchasing decision. The results are expected to provide useful insights on how consumers search, utilize information and make purchase decisions in the online market.

%X Social commerce has emerged as a new online commerce platform which enhances users’ interactions and information contributions. Hence, social aspects are important elements in these environments. Nevertheless, the potential influence of social facets on social commerce users’ behaviors is not yet fully understood. In this study, we are interested in examining the influence of social factors in driving social commerce users’ impulse buying behaviors. Drawing from Latent State-Trait theory, we suggest that environmental cues, users’ personality traits, and interactions between these two elements can influence users’ urge to buy impulsively. To capture the social aspects of social commerce platforms, this study considers environmental cues from two different perspectives; the stimuli from other members, and from the website itself. Potential contributions to research and practice are discussed.

Whereas drones are currently used in a variety of industry landscapes, such as filmmaking and agriculture, we focus particularly on the shipping industry. In this paper, we take the customers’ perspective and evaluate why customers would engage in drone deliveries. We investigate the influence of trust, perceived risk, and motivational factors and propose a research model that seeks to explain the customers’ intention. This study uses survey data (n = 116) and structural equation modeling. Our results provide empirical evidence that trust and perceived risk, as well as specific motivational factors influence the customers’ intention to engage in drone deliveries.

%X Assessing the creditworthiness of prospective business partners is the first step in conducting trade. Traditionally the creditworthiness of partners was assessed using transactional methods, methods based on close observation of the other party and the heavy use of mostly subjective, soft information. During recent decades, however, these relational methods were largely replaced with transactional methods relying almost exclusively on objective financial data, otherwise known as hard data. A considerable portion of firms involved in business to business trade are now small companies that do not to have any reliable or comparable financial information. In the absence of such information, transactional methods of assessing business creditworthiness have very limited practical value. To provide a remedy, this study proposes using non-financial information available from the Web and thus a return to the more transactional methods. We identify sources of credit-related information available from a typical business to business exchange and test if such information can predict firm creditworthiness. We conduct a study with a group of online businesses on a major B2B exchange and empirically show that a number of non-financial factors can in fact predict online businesses’ level of creditworthiness.

%X Business-to-Business Electronic Commerce (B2B EC) technologies have been widely adopted by organizations in developed countries to improve the management of supply chain activities. However, organizations in Middle Eastern countries have been slow in adopting B2B EC technologies. To enrich our understanding of the reasons for this slow uptake, this exploratory study compares the experience of Bahraini and Australian organizations with the adoption of B2B EC technologies. This study employs a multiple case study with a total of 14 organizations from the grocery industry of both countries. From the case comparison, we identify some reasons for the reluctance of organizations in Bahrain to adopt B2B EC technologies, although the national environment and the organizational capability generally support the adoption. We particularly highlight the importance of the positive mutual interactions between organizations and their trading partners within the industry for the adoption of B2B EC, which is currently lacking within the Bahraini grocery industry.

%X In recent years mobile games have become a major part of the mobile market since gaming apps generate a major amount of the platforms revenue. Whilst different business models have been used - free to play seems one of the most promising to monetize games in the mobile market. Yet, this new concept of monetizing digital content has not obtained much attention of researchers. One research gap is the prediction of users purchasing behavior, as it is a major challenge for practitioners as well as for researchers and of vital importance for managing marketing expenses and designing game mechanics. In this paper we use an existing prediction model for purchasing behavior to analyze its applicability in the mobile market. We use two data sets from free to play games to train and test this well-known model. We can show that existing models, even though they are designed for the same type of customer relationship, struggle with the case of free to play. We show detailed information on the model performance and conclude that because of the unique purchasing behavior in free to play models should be redesigned or the process of application should be more structured.

%X It is an emerging phenomenon that Internet celebrity live streaming shows are applied in eCommerce to provide online marketing service. We propose the “lifestyle-centric” design principle to guide the design of IT-mediated marketing service contents and explore how the IT-mediated service contents affect purchase intention. In the research model, value compatibility, consumption experience transmission and product presentation are hypothesized to improve purchase intention. The three factors are proposed as formative second-order constructs formed by a set of IT-mediated service functions. Value compatibility comprises vision, personalization, consumption cues and inspiration. Consumption experience transmission comprises trialability, result demonstrability, rehearsal, training, and analogical mapping and transferring. Product presentation comprises multimedia advertising, visual control, vicarious tactile control, and spatial navigation. We outline the research design of a survey to test the theoretical model. Once completed, our study will provide implications regarding the design of IT-mediated functions for a lifestyle-centric online marketing service.

%X Most online auction platform providers (OAPPs) agree that the majority of their profits comes from users, i.e., their buyers and sellers. The major concern of OAPPs is how to gain and lock in users in order to maintain and enhance a competitive edge. Customer switching is one of the primary problems of all companies, including OAPPs. This study focused on online auction sellers and attempted to understand their switching behavior. We developed an integrated model that consisted of OAPP strategies (anti-switching and anti-lock-in), value-based factors (platform qualities and switching costs), lock-in factors (network effects), and perceived values to explore the switching intentions of online auction sellers. The model was tested using a field study of 248 sellers from two online auction websites. The results show that OAPP strategies will affect switching costs which affect perceived value which, in turn, impacts a seller’s switching behavior. Our findings indicate that value-based factors directly influence perceived value which could suitably explain a seller’s decision to switch from one OAPP to another. The study suggests that OAPPs should develop strategies and leverage the network effect to avoid customer switching.

%X Social shopping communities provide online platform for customers to communicate their opinions and exchange product information. In this study, we explored the factors driving customer information sharing behavior in social shopping communities. We proposed and empirically tested an integrative theoretical model of customer information sharing based on social capital theory. We adopted an empirical analysis approach and collected subjective survey data and objective behavioural usage data over two months from 1,177 customers in a social shopping community. Our results generally support the theoretical model and our hypotheses. Our results show that customer information sharing is determined by social capital (i.e., indegree centrality, outdegree centrality, shared language, shared vision, and trust) factors. These results contribute significantly to the literature and provide important implications for future research and practice.

%X Empirical research has shown mixed results regarding the effect of online review attributes (e.g., tone, valence, congruence) on consumer perceptions of reviews. Drawing on selectivity theory and cognitive dissonance theory, we dive deeper into decision making to understand how different people perceive helpfulness. The study explores the interplay between review attributes and gender on perceptions of review helpfulness. We conducted a between-subject, controlled laboratory experiment to test our model. We propose that review information congruence plays an important role in evaluating online review helpfulness. We also expect that women consider negative informative and positive persuasive online reviews more helpful whereas men consider positive informative and negative persuasive online reviews more helpful. The study brings important extensions to existing research on relationships between online review helpfulness and online review attributes.

%X Business models have gained much interest in the last decade to analyze the potential of new business ventures or possible innovation paths of existing businesses. However, the business model concept has only rarely been used as basis for quantitative empirical studies. This paper suggests the concept of a Business Model DNA to describe the characteristics of specific business models. This concept allows to analyze business models in order to identify clusters of business models that outperform others and calculate future prospects of specific business models. We used 181 startups from the USA and Germany and applied data mining techniques, i.e. cluster analysis and Support Vector Machines, to classify different business models in regards to their performance. Our findings show that 12 distinct business model clusters with different growth expectations and chances of survival exist. We can predict the survival of a venture with an accuracy of 83.6 %.

%X motivation. This study uses a grounded theory approach to develop a theoretical model that illustrates these challenges. As a starting point, this study discusses the difference between the potential and the actual status of online auction repurchase behaviour motivation. Having conducted a literature review and 20 interviews, this study discovered that the main challenges to online auction repurchase behaviour motivation: are trading experiences, switching costs, customers’ consumption value perspectives, and negatively, a lack of post-purchase guarantee and supervision for all online sellers. This study contributes to the literature on IS-enabled online auction trading platforms in the online seller perspective by deriving propositions for online auction repurchase behaviour motivation. By developing a theoretical model of the main challenges to online auction repurchase behaviour motivation it explains the difference between the theoretical and practical motivation of online auction repurchase behaviour.

%X This study focuses on trust formation and development in global buyer-supplier relationships. Trust affects all business relationships, especially global business-to-business (B2B) transactions due to the distances between buyers and suppliers. We use information signaling theory to examine how information indices and signals affect buyers’ trust in suppliers in global B2B commerce. Specifically, we examine how buyers’ trust is affected by (1) their perceptions of the national integrity and legal structure of suppliers’ country, and (2) third-party verifications of suppliers on B2B exchanges. Because buyer-supplier relationships usually evolve over time, we study how the effects of indices and signals change as the number of transactions between the partners increases. A survey of global organizational buyers finds that perceptions of national integrity, legal structure, and supplier verifications are all positively related to buyers’ trust. However, the number of prior transactions between buyers and suppliers moderates the impact of perceived legal structure on buyers’ trust.

%X Large-scale data generated by crowds provide a myriad of opportunities for monitoring and modeling people's intentions, preferences, and opinions. A crucial step in analyzing such "Big Data" is identifying the relevant data items that should be provided as input to the modeling process. Interestingly, this important step has received limited attention in previous research. This paper proposes a novel crowd-based approach to this data selection problem: leveraging crowds to amplify the predictive capacity of search trend data (Google Trends). We developed an online word association task that taps into people's "thought-collection" process when thinking about a focal term. We empirically tested this method in two domains that have been used as test-beds for prediction. The method yields predictions that are equivalent or superior to those obtained in previous studies (using alternative data selection methods) and to predictions obtained using various benchmark data selection methods.

%X Social commerce, the use of social media in e-commerce, has become an attractive means for companies to generate business value from consumers' online social interactions. However, many e-commerce companies today are still trying to understand which factors drive consumers to participate in social commerce. While first empirical studies have examined one or more factors that influence consumers' adoption of social commerce, the findings of these studies are scattered across the literature base, sometimes not transparent, and not straightforwardly comparable. To synthesize these findings, we conduct a systematic literature review. After analyzing 38 academic publications, we contribute a comprehensive and structured list of factors that influence consumers' adoption of social commerce. The results of our work provide implications for future research to develop a more complete understanding of consumers' adoption of social commerce. Practitioners can use our results to improve the effectiveness of their social commerce initiatives.

%X Research and practice in the information systems (IS) field have been evolving over time, nourishing and promoting the development of applications that transform the relationships of individuals, corporations, and governments. Building on this evolution, we push forward a vision of the potential influence of the IS field into one of the most important problems of our times, an increasingly unsustainable world, which is traditionally considered the product of imperfect markets or market externalities. We describe our work in Full Information Product Pricing (FIPP) and our vision of a FIPP global socio-technical system, I-Choose, as a way to connect consumer choice and values with environmental, social, and economic effects of production and distribution practices. FIPP and I-Choose represent a vision about how information systems research can contribute to interdisciplinary research in supply chains, governance, and market economies to provide consumers with information packages that help them better understand how, where, and by whom the products they buy are produced. We believe that such a system will have important implications for international trade and agreements, for public policy, and for making a more sustainable world.

%X Mobile network creates an environment that is convenient with fast communication and no localization restriction in which it is a perfect network environment for mobile commerce websites in developing business information applications and services. Two Shopping Malls also launched many mobile commerce website services to capture the gradually growing market. Depending on how convenient and fast these services that the website provides consumers, the quality of these services will determine the consumers’ decision to leave or stay on the website, and the usability of the website will be their deciding factor. This study reviewed how a website with better usability that offers consumers high efficiency and effectiveness with the ease of learning and memorizing have a strong influence over the buying behavior of consumers. This study used experimental questionnaire method to evaluate the usability in different Shopping Mall websites. Before the experiment, this study analyzed what would the expected processes and problems would be for these websites. After the experiment, this study compared the data retrieved from the questionnaires with the experiments of actual problems. The results showed that the psychology in the questionnaire and the physiology in the real-life situation of subjects corresponded with each other. In the usability guidelines, there are significant differences between Two Shopping Malls in the area of effectiveness and learning abilities. After the cross examination of the speculated expectation of the processes and problems on these websites with the actual problems in real-time, the results showed top three issues that were found on second Shopping Mall’s " Registration Process" played huge influences on the consumer’s behavior. This study proposed various ways of website improvements for better usability after analyzing the problems resulted from poor user interface design with the services provided on this website.

%X This study tests the effects of users’ self-congruence and personal innovativeness on consumer engagement in the context of mobile banking (m-banking) and mobile payment (m-payment) applications. In addition, it examines the effects of engagement and perceived risk on continuous usage intention. We test our hypotheses with two convenience samples of users of m-banking and m-payment applications (total N=1516) using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that a) self-congruence positively influences all three types of consumer engagement, b) personal innovativeness has a small effect on cognitive processing and affection, c) affection and activation have a positive impact on continuous usage intention, and d) perceived risk moderates the relationship between affection and continuous usage intention. The study contributes to the emerging consumer engagement literature and gives managerial insight into enhancing the level of consumer engagement and continuous usage intention of m-banking and m-payment applications.

%X Coined by Tan et al. (2006), â€œduo-miningâ€ recognizes the synergy produced by combining the traditional data mining techniques with the relatively new analytical methods called text mining, the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources (Hearst, n.d.). While data mining proves to be effective when the data to be analyzed is structured, attention given to text mining lately is on the rise along with the staggering growth in volume of textual data found in the public domain such as tweets and various customer reviews. \  \ Making a case for duo-mining has been done through measuring the lift in predictive modeling. Data mining is known to produce a significant lift in comparison to the baseline predictive methods such as random walk. Use of text mining also shows to create a significant lift over the efficacy of baseline prediction. When the two methods are combined, the lift is even higher than either text mining or text mining is employed alone. \  \ Customer reviews have proven to be a fertile ground to authenticate the efficacy of duo-mining by combining numerical data (star ratings) and textual data (customer review narratives). Customer reviews in popular e-commerce sites are intended to provide new or potential customers with helpful information to assist in purchase decisions (Mudambi & Schuff, 2010). However, helpfulness of such reviews suffers from the disconnect between the quantitative measures and the qualitative assessment, and studies have pointed out the disconnect between the two (Mudambi, Schuff, & Zhang, 2014; Chung 2018). The potential business value of enhanced predictive power gained through duo-mining notwithstanding, such a gain tends to be ephemeral and confined to narrow domains due to the inherent nature of data collected from social network sites.  \  \ In this TREO talk, we present a novel approach of applying the duo-mining techniques to proprietary data sets of historical college admission applications, whereby not only the lift gain in the predictive power is confirmed but also strategic insights are gleaned by noting the similarities and differences in essays and recommendations, following the cluster hypothesis (van Rijsbergen, 1979). \

%X From the perspective of product uncertainty, the effect of product type, product price and sales on buyer’s online payment method choice was explored with a 2 price levels (high vs. low) × 2 sales levels (high vs. low) × 2 product types (experience vs. search) within-subjects eye-tracking experiment. Thirty voluntary participants from Zhejiang University participated in the experiment. The determinants of payment method choice were examined in three levels data including observable behavior data, attention eye-tracking data, and psychometric cognitive data. Repeated measures ANOVE and logistics regression indicated that product uncertainty and price were the two main determinants of online payment method choice. Pay-after-delivery was more likely to be chosen when price or product uncertainty was high. However, sales had no significant effect on the choice. The analysis of eye-tracking data, including dwell time and duration before on AOI-price and AOI-sales, found that buyers first paid attention to and had more cognitive effort on the price than sales. This study extended the theory of product uncertainty, and provided cognitive processing of information behind online payment method choice. The results of this study can help the online sellers optimize the service of payment, finally improving the development of e-business.

The review deals with those studies that have an empirical and quantitative component, and those studies where the emphasis has been on testing theories of user acceptance. The paper establishes three phases in which Bled delegates have gradually extended generic user acceptance models to deal with issues of electronic commerce. The first phase (20012003) is one of theory application. The second phase (2004-2007) is one of theory extension. In the third phase, (2008-2011), Bled delegates move beyond traditional models and adopt alternative theoretical approaches. The review ends with three promising avenues for further research in electronic commerce.

%X Social commerce is a new concept in consumer activity which has emerged through the phenomenon of social media. Social commerce platform tends to create an environment where consumers can interact with users and marketer. Also, it has been portrayed as a means of managing brands for businesses. This research explores the relationships among social interaction, social support, relationship quality, and consumers' intention to co-create brand value with applying social support and relationship marketing theories. Empirical data were collected from a social networking website in China. The results demonstrate that social commerce interactions, specifically, user perspective and marketer perspective, positively affect social support and in turn, intention to co-create brand value. Social support positively affects relationship quality. This study provides new insights by proposing a model of co-create brand through social commerce interactions.

%X This paper seeks to answer two questions: (1) Do consumers perceive the four service quality dimensions (reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy) differently when interacting with Self-Service Technologies (SSTs) and human agents? and (2) How do these four dimensions affect consumers’ satisfaction when using SSTs versus using human agents? Based on an extensive literature review, we propose that consumers will perceive higher service quality from human agents compared to from SSTs. Additionally, we propose that higher service quality will have a positive impact on consumer satisfaction. We tested our propositions using experimental data collected from 181 subjects. The results indicated that consumers perceived higher levels of reliability, assurance, and empathy from human agents  compared to SSTs, but did not perceive a significant difference in responsiveness. Furthermore, the service quality dimensions affected consumer satisfaction differently when receiving service from human agents versus SSTs. This study raises important implications for research and practice.

%X This study examines how the initially perceived product value affects a consumer’s purchase intention after he/she reads various tones of online reviews. It proposes that the associations among the initially perceived product value, the level of confirmation made by reading reviews and final purchase intention would differ across review tones that; 1) when the tone is extreme, the impact of confirmation will be stronger than when the tone is moderate and 2) when the tone is favorable, the impact of initially perceived product value will be stronger than when the tone is critical. The survey was conducted to 276 online shopping mall users in Korea and most of hypotheses were supported. This study emphasizes that the impact of online review should be discussed together with the level of expectation that a customer had before reading online reviews, because the customers have to go through searching and screening processes before reading online reviews.

%X Recommender system, which helps consumers to filter through large information and enhance consumers’ shopping experience and loyalty, is a critical application of big data analytics in retail industry. Many recommender systems are proposed and applied to real-word applications. However, existing recommender systems mainly concentrate on predicting the preference scores of unknown/unpurchased items to target users but ignore the consideration of consumers’ repeated consumption behaviors. Such assumption is not reasonable in some applications, such as department stores or grocery stores where repeated consumptions are common. Accordingly, this study concentrates on addressing this limitation by incorporating item repurchased probabilities into recommendation generation. The proposed repurchase-based collaborative filtering (RP-CF) technique has the ability to recommend both unpurchased and repurchased items. We collect a real-world dataset from a major chain department store in Taiwan for empirical evaluation. The findings are promising and shown that the RP-CF technique indeed improves the performance of personalized recommendation.

%X Crowdsourcing is a well-developed concept, which has become very prevalent with the growth and development of the Internet; Web 2.0 in particular. CustomerSourcing is a sub-category of Crowdsourcing which has developed a following in recent years. This article explains the development and conceptual underpinnings of CustomerSourcing; followed by the introduction of a 16-point framework for identifying specific intrinsic motivators. The motivation framework is applied to the major categories of Crowdsourcing; followed by a more specific application to CustomerSourcing in particular. The value of such a model is to help web site developers identify the specific motivators for the potential site users; so that the motivators can be enhanced and supported – resulting in improved web sites with increased use and increased frequency of use.

%X As mobile devices rapidly proliferate and internet services expand concomitantly, a confluence of the two enables users to access the internet on their mobile-cellular devices for a variety of purposes. In this paper, we examine mobile adoption and mobile internet usage in 3,108 counties of the United States for e-entertainment and e-commerce purposes. Spatial patterns of mobile internet adoption and usage are explored to understand the extent of the mobile internet digital divide in the US. Using the Spatially Aware Technology Utilization Model, socio-economic, innovation, affordability, and social capital influences on mobile adoption and mobile internet use are examined. Spatial dimensions of county-level mobile internet activity and evidence of strong association of geodemographic and tariff variables emphasize the importance of market forces on mobile internet usage. Policies to bridge the mobile internet digital divide are recommended based upon the significant influence of market factors, innovation, and affordability.

%X There are limited studies on the relationship between internal marketing and service quality in Uganda though in the west interest in internal marketing seems to have intensified from 2006 onwards,[1]. Customers no longer simply pay for services: they co –produce with the contact employees at the time of transaction and therefore the customer buying experience has to be understood from both the employees’ and customer perspectives, [2] The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between internal marketing, employee job satisfaction and service quality. Survey research method was used with the primary data being collected from 91 employees and 96 clients of one selected firm in the aviation industry in Uganda. The study results showed that Internal marketing has a strong positive correlation with service quality (r=0.723**, p-value< 0.01) while internal marketing and employee job satisfaction are significantly correlated (r=0.871**, p-value< 0.01) and are strongly positively correlated. Employee job satisfaction showed a significant positive correlation with service quality (r=0.895**, p-value<0.01). The practical implication of our study is that internal marketing has a fundamental contribution in the delivery of service quality. The study findings inform managers, who have hitherto tended to put more emphasis on the external customer, to change their perspective as taking the internal customer for granted may result in negative outcomes for their organizations.

%X To better understand hedonic utility of social media users, we conducted a study among university students using musicians’ Facebook pages for digital content consumption. Our study measures the effects of peer influence and media richness as subjects evaluated different musician’s pages with different levels of both effects. The results show support for our key hypothesis that social media users are influenced by peer influence in making choices to “like” something. More importantly, the key aspects of the product (in our case, music) were less of a predictor of consumer choice.

%X To help consumers find the most wanted products effectively, e-commerce recommendation saves lots of time spent on viewing unnecessary web pages and increases revenue for ecommerce websites. Because of this significance, this paper concentrates on technology of recommendation and makes an improvement to recommender system. To solve the problem of current technology that only concerns association between two products, this model considers the product network and guides consumers to view products following the intended path. The object is to maximize revenue of the entire product network. An empirical study of yhd.com shows our model is more effective than current model.

%X Online product reviews are influential sources of information that some companies attempt to manipulate by compensating reviewers for favorable comments. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has mandated disclosure of reviewer compensation to address this potential conflict of interest, but the effect of such disclosures on consumer attitudes is unknown. By extending prominence–interpretation theory, this work reconciles conflicting empirical results by introducing two novel elements of prominence (i.e., proximity and embedding) and demonstrating the effect disclosures have on reviewer credibility through two experiments (N = 750). The effects of social consensus and prior warnings on how consumers interpret disclosures are also studied. Using a general population sample (N = 346), Experiment 1 demonstrated that proximity to review increased disclosure prominence while embedding the disclosure in the review decreased disclosure prominence. More prominent disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but less prominent disclosures had no effect. Using a student sample (N = 404), Experiment 2 demonstrated that disclosure interpretation is affected by prior warnings about conflicts of interest and the consensus of other reviews. When there was disagreement between reviews and prior warnings were provided, disclosures reduced reviewer credibility, but when there was a consensus of positive reviews or no consensus information was provided, disclosures had no effect. Our studies show that both prominence and interpretation are important to consider in understanding the effects of disclosure statements. However, variables associated with prominence produced the most robust results. The theoretical implications of these results and the practical implications for consumers, companies, and policymakers are discussed.

%X To satisfy service customers and create unique value in a digitized world, companies must strive for exceeding customers’ expectations of e-service experience by establishing high e-service quality. However, an increasing amount of e-services is performed by context-aware mobile technology, which is able to sense and react to changes in the user’s environment. Although these context-aware services are able to address our personal needs and already determine our everyday live, knowledge on how to develop such services is sparse. In our study, we qualitatively compare three mobile navigation apps based on their user reviews in order to elicit first requirements and design approaches for e-service quality oriented design. Results show that well known e-service quality models are not fully applicable to the case of mobile navigation services.

%X This paper examines digital entrepreneurship in born digital and grown digital firms. Of late, digital entrepreneurship has garnered renewed attention from national leaders, practitioners, and academics due to the phenomenal success of a number of digital startups and the radical disruptions brought by the innovative use of technologies. Despite the significance and the promises of digital technology, especially amid the gloomy economy, digital entrepreneurship has remained inadequately analyzed for its predominant focus on entrepreneurs (human agency) and newly founded firms (context). This study offers an in-depth analysis of two entrepreneurial firms, Yihaodian and Suning, which are among the largest e-commerce players in China. By adopting effectuation as our theoretical lens, this study aims to generate an understanding of the digital entrepreneurial process in both born digital and grown digital firms.

%X The growing application of the Internet technology continues to influence many dimensions of contemporary business practices. Attitudinal dynamics constitutes one of the instrumental applications of this piece of technological innovation of online transactions. In spite of the claimed benefits of ecommerce elsewhere, there are yet several challenges born out of unpredictable customer attitudes that continue to challenge the meaningful exploitation of this novel market experience. This study applies both qualitative and quantitative research techniques with compressed view of attitude theory as a lens to make sense of the behavioural dimensions that impinge the practice of ecommerce in developing countries. The study reveals the inherent risks connected with online trading practices and the likelihood of undermining the enduring prospects of online commercial activities, especially in the developing world has a functional bearing on attitudinal orientation.

%X From the perspectives of the operational objectives of the green supply chain management and in consideration of its economic efficiency, social and environmental impact as well as its unique characteristics, this paper examines the pricing issues of the green supply chain for home appliances industry by using game theory and contract coordination theory. Considering the influences of the effective recycle behavior of the used home appliances to the whole supply chain, the paper proposes a game model for the portfolio pricing for the wholesale, retail and recycle price based on retailer recycling model. Then a revenue and expense-sharing contract model is designed to improve the game effects, by allocating both total revenues and expenses related to the manufacturing, retailing and recycling operations in the green supply chain among all participating players, thus maximizing the profits and effectiveness of the supply chain as a whole. The pricing models presented in this paper provide a practical and theoretical guidance for home appliances enterprises in making pricing decisions and supply chain contracts.

%X Choice closure refers to the psychological process by which decision makers come to perceive a decision to be complete and settled and has been found to significantly influence consumers’ satisfaction in physical retail environments. We propose a closure interface as an effective/efficient mechanism for inducing customers’ choice closure in online environments. We build a research model based on theory of closure, theory of cognitive dissonance, social influence theory, and interruption. We first investigate the effects of various designs of closure interfaces on perceived decision completeness, reduced choice comparison, and perceived interruption. We then examine the nomological networks between these constructs, perceived choice closure, and satisfaction. We will conduct two controlled experiments (n=240) in a simulated online electronics site by manipulating the presence of direct and social reinforcer, the relevance-level of a reinforcer, and the actor of closure action in a closure interface and present the MANOVA and SEM analysis result.

It is very important for healthcare providers to analyze this type of big data following the logic of customer relationship management. So here we propose an integration framework which can realize the customer segmentation and customer churn prediction together. To efficiently segment the customer and predict the churn, we propose a novel combining method which can combine several ANN models and consider multiple accuracy measures.

The empirical data in all cases consist of observations of users’ and potential customers’ experiences with different MR applications followed by qualitative interviews. The study assesses how various MR applications can create experience-centric services. The research focus is in service and sensory design as well as in customer experience management. The study results suggest that MR can provide new opportunities for prolonged customer experiences in terms of new encounters and cues, different sensory effects and improved social interactions among business representatives and fellow customers. Furthermore, MR experiences can generate positive word-of-mouth especially in cases with dramatic structures. Finally, the results suggest that the customers' willingness-to-interact with service personnel increase after a MR experience.

%X Many companies have realized the enormous potential of social networking sites and have invested considerable resources in encouraging consumer engagement behaviors in brand communities of social networking sites. In this study, we attempt to propose a research model that explains how consumer engagement behaviors in brand communities of social networking sites affect brand loyalty.  The research model is empirically tested with 201 Facebook users. The results provide supports to our research hypotheses and illustrate the importance of consumer engagement behaviors in social networking sites in building brand loyalty. Findings of this study are expected to provide useful insights for emarketers to develop brand loyalty through consumer engagement behaviors in online social networks as well as for researchers to better understand the relationship between consumer engagement behaviors in online brand community and consumer behavior.

%X Timing online auctions to attract a large number of prospective buyers is important for sellers. This study examines whether online auction sellers need to account for exogenous effects like TV viewing when timing and predicting their auction results. An ongoing debate questions whether TV viewers can spread their attention across multiple devices while watching TV, for example, by concurrently shopping online or posting on social media. Recent research has focused on understanding cross-media effects; however, little attention has been given to TV viewership’s relationship with a very important economic activity, namely participation in online auctions. 
%X We examine this potential cross-media effect by analyzing the four-year sales history of a German online auction platform and addressing potential endogeneity problems with an instrumental variable approach. We use three different instrumental variables that have different advantages and disadvantages but can, in sum, be used for triangulation as they lead to the same result. The analyses reveal a significant negative cross-media effect between TV consumption and online auction sales, indicating that TV consumption and online auction sales might compete for the scarce attention of consumers and are thus substitutes for each other rather than complements.

%X Branded applications (apps) became a new trend in mobile marketing because they offer a better way to capture on-the-go consumers. This study thus explores how to promote app users’ continuance intention and purchase intention (i.e., “app continuance”) toward a specific branded app. By integrating service-dominant (S-D) logic and task-technology fit, this study utilizes a unifying model to examine how task-service fit (TSF) influences app continuance. This study identifies task characteristic and four service characteristics (interactivity, presence, localization, and ubiquity) as antecedents of TSF. Psychological barriers are examined as mediators of TSF and purchase intention within S-D logic. Data collected from 631 users of the targeted branded apps support all of the proposed hypotheses. The findings show that TSF is an essential determinant of both app continuance in the context of branded apps and a partial mediator of psychological barriers between TSF and purchase intention. The results provide new perspectives for designers and marketers of branded apps on how to create better service experiences for their customers.

%X Channel-switching, cross-channel free-riding, and research shopping is causing problems for companies offering multiple channels. Either customers could choose a channel that is more expensive for the company or they inform themselves in one channel but switch to a competitor for the final purchase. We aim to influence channel choice by using the recently proposed IS concept of digital nudging. In particular, we leverage the nudges of social norms and perceived risk in the online channel. In addition to this concept, we propose that the individual context of the user, like gender or personality, has to be incorporated as a moderator by designing customer specific (i.e. adaptive) nudges. To test these hypotheses, we outline an experiment design for a lab experiment and show how multi-channel choices can be influenced with design interventions in the form of nudges. As previous studies have only tested static nudges, we contribute to existing research by enhancing the nudge theory to adaptively consider user characteristics. Moreover, we apply the nudge theory to the new context of multi-channel choices. Finally, we provide guidance for practitioners on designing their own online channels.

%X The future of e-commerce is changing with the more recent emergence of social commerce. Web 2.0 has affected e-commerce, resulting in the emergence of a new concept known as social commerce. For a long time trust has been considered a challenge for both parties in e-commerce transactions; trust is also now challenging s-commerce. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) the author analyses trust along with some of the components of social commerce which affect the intention to buy among individuals by proposing and testing Social Commerce Adoption Model (SCAM). This research gathers survey data and applies structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the data. The results show trust is influential in s-commerce. The influence of trust is also strong on consumers’ intentions to buy. Limitations and implications are discussed in the end.

%X Online consumer product reviews, an important form of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The reviews provide potential buyers with product comments and evaluations from a user’s perspective. This paper examines how the sequence of negative reviews, the quantity of online feedback text and the quality of online comments affect consumer purchase intention. The experiments results suggest that the quantity and quality of online consumer product reviews have a positive effect on consumer purchase intention. However, consumers show a negativity bias for products when negative consumer reviews concentrate in the front.

%X Most research examining individuals’ bidding behavior in online auctions has used the lens of a rational decision making process. However, bidding behavior is also influenced by non-rational factors. Anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to a non-human object, has been studied in many disciplines, but has not been investigated in online auctions. This study aims to identify whether auditory and visual design factors for a non-human product would induce anthropomorphism and impact individuals' bidding decision. Results show that visual design induces individuals’ anthropomorphism and also impacts bidding decisions.

%X As more people access to social network services (SNS), especially by using mobile devices, more organizations become to use SNS as a channel for their marketing and promotion. It is known that the growth potential of the mobile advertising market is significant. While brand engagement is a key motive for mobile advertising, there is a lack of understanding about how SNS users become to engage with the brand of promoting organization and the consequences in the mobile SNS context. This study examines brand engagement of a user with a promoting company in the mobile SNS marketing context by adopting customer value theory. Based on the customer value types, this study identifies antecedents of mobile brand engagement. The findings show the significance of three factors (price discount, relationship support, and convenience) of mobile SNS marketing on the brand engagement. The findings further show the significant consequences of brand engagement such as purchase decisions and word-of-mouth activities. These findings help advance theory and offer practical insights on the use of information systems and marketing in the context of mobile SNS.

From an e-service provider standpoint, we describe three dimension of product/service and business models (Value Networker, Fantasy Fulfiller, and Solutionist) that are unique to experience centric e-service. We also provide real-world examples to describe how businesses make experience centric e-service possible. As a paradigm shift, our experience centric e-service is compared with earlier view of e-service in Value creation, Characteristics, Provider, and User to increase the depth of our conceptualization. Constraints of creating effective experience centric e-service are also elaborated to help businesses to overcome the managerial and technological issues. Furthermore, designing and delivering aggregated online services are also discussed in details. Implication for information systems research is also discussed.

%X The fast-growing information and communication technologies have shifted the contemporary commerce in both its information and market spaces. Businesses demand a new generation of agile and adaptive commerce systems. Towards this end, software agents, a type of autonomous artifacts, have been viewed as a promising solution. They have been taking an increasingly important part in facilitating e-commerce operations in the last two decades. This article presents a systematized overview of the diversity of agent applications in commerce. The paper argues that agents start playing more substantial role in determining social affairs. They also have a strong potential to be used to build the future highly responsive and smart e-commerce systems. The opportunities and challenges presented by proliferation of agent technologies in e-commerce necessitate the development of insights into their place in information systems research, as well as practical implications for the management.

%X In this research, the authors examine members’ decisions to continue using social networking sites. Site use leads to the growth of social relationships, increased volume of site traffic, and an accumulation of user-generated contents; hence, it is imperative to the long-term success of social networking sites. Drawing on the Theory of Consumption Value, we develop a research model to examine the key values that members derive from networking sites. This model systematically identifies functional, social, epistemic, emotional, and conditional values and contends that these values influence members’ continued site-use decisions. In addition, the research model captures the major determinants of the five value constructs as stemming from networking service attributes, member personalities, website designs, and computing environment. The research model was empirically validated through survey data collected from social networking site users, and the analysis results provided strong support to the hypothesized relationships. The current study generates new knowledge on the literature of social networking sites; it also sheds light on site management for networking service providers.

%X Bicycle-sharing application has developed rapidly in China in the past few years, and how to improve its service quality has become an important research topic. Drawing upon expectation confirmation theory and the SERVQUAL model, this study aims to examine the influence of perceived service quality on customers’ satisfaction and continuance intention of the bicycle-sharing application. Data was collected from 437 customers of the leading bicycle sharing service platforms in China, and structural equation modeling technique was used to examine the research model. The empirical results suggest that perceived tangible is the most significant service dimension that positively influences customers’ confirmation, followed by response, empathy and reliability. Further, customers’ confirmation of service quality is positively associated with satisfaction, which in turn promotes their continuance intention. Theoretical implications and practical implications are discussed in the final section.

%X Digital products and services are an integral part of everyday life for both individuals and organizations. Further, given that digitalization greatly impacts our society and in particular how customer and organizations interact, organizations need to react to changing business rules and to leverage opportunities associated with digital technologies. Accordingly, the chief information officer (CIO) role is frequently a flexible one in the sense that it encompasses a much broader perspective on organizations than before. Most of the CIOs or newly appointed chief digital officers (CDOs) whom we interviewed in the course of our study recognized the need for change catalyzed by emerging digital technologies, but they typically lacked comprehensive knowledge on how to scope digital transformation initiatives. Against this background, we develop and validate a holistic framework of action fields for digital transformation. Our framework builds on extant literature and a series of exploratory interviews with over 50 organizations, and we have validated it in numerous contexts. In this paper, we present our framework and demonstrate its application at ZEISS, one of the organizations that participated in our study.

%X With technology advanced and flourishing of wired or wireless networks in our daily life, privacy and trustability of transaction media are highly cherished value. Individuals often make choices in which they surrender a certain degree of privacy in exchange for outcomes that are perceived to be worth of the risk of information disclosure. This research attempts to facilitate understandings of utility of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) which is a strongly supported and well-established vehicle in information research when it incorporate privacy, risk, and trust factor that are previously regarded as separate research area from TAM. The proposed model was tested using data gathered from 309 respondents from internet survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) using Mplus was employed to validate measurement and structural model. Based on this outcome, the measurements were redefined as composite scores and subsequent path analysis was conducted to test proposed hypotheses. The findings provide the structural or causal model of proposed model attainable but it requires development of reliable and valid measurement scales.

%X Individuals’ bidding behavior in online auctions has been the subject of research in Information System. Most research has used the lens of a rational decision making process to explain individuals’ bidding behavior. However, bidding behavior is also influenced by non-rational factors. Anthropomorphism, attributing human characteristics to a non-human object, has been the research topic of many disciplines but has not been investigated in the area of electronic commerce. This study aims to understand neurophysiological processes underlying anthropomorphism affecting bidding decision using electroencephalography (EEG) methodology. Results show that different areas of brain in the frontal lobe of the brain were activated between bidding for anthropomorphized products and regular products. This study opens a new conversion on the research of anthropomorphism in the area of Information System. It creates a more holistic understanding of the impact of anthropomorphism on individuals’ behaviors for future research.

%X In this theory-building research, we seek to understand how the emerging systems of e-intermediation influnce the evolution of novel inter-organizational networks. We chose Yoox, a leading e-intermediary in the fashion industry, as an exemplary case. We found that the core technological capabilities of the e-intermediator, rather than deterministically triggering a single coordination strategy (as mainstream literature predicts), have been exploited to develop a range of interaction approaches, including market, hierarchy, and cooperative network relationships. At this phase of our research in progress, we can extract provisionary propositions from our field study. The most representative propositions we elaborated are the following: (i) when Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) empower e-intermediation B2B interactions, they can effectively support market, hierarchy, or cooperative network interactions; that is, ICTs facilitate inter-organizational dynamism; (ii) e-intermediation does not encourage, per se, preferential or typical inter-organizational coordination forms. Partnering organizations develop market and/or hierarchy and/or cooperative network interactions depending on their perceptions of irreplaceability, as well as on other factors such as managerial strategies, concerns, and previous relational experiences; (iii) in e-intermediation business networks, the e-intermediary´s technological leadership is more likely to produce a long-term competitive advantage if it is leveraged to feed and enrich the e-intermediary´s relational leadership dynamically over time.

%X As the development of information technologies (IT) influences consumer behavior, consumers now search for information and establish their purchase intention earlier in the process. Nonetheless, little research to date has examined how consumers make a decision to purchase a product early in the process, that is, at the prelaunch stage of the product. Delivering the right information at the right time would be important for consumers to evaluate and decide to purchase the products as well as for firms to increase preorder and subsequent sales. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the consumer decision making at the prelaunch stage of IT products, particularly in terms of product-related information and consumers’ decision timing. We propose that the interaction between product-related information and decision timing plays a salient role in affecting consumer decisions (i.e., consumer attraction and preorder purchase intention). Contributions of this paper include (1) a suggested framework extending the timeline of consumer decision making process which have traditionally concerned the decision timing at the initial post-launch stage or repurchase stage, and (2) an understanding of effective product information management for firms to manipulate potential consumers’ purchase decisions in earlier timing.

%X As the proliferation of social media and live streaming, online celebrity endorsement is a common practice of content marketing in e-commerce platform. Despite the prevalent use of social media and online community, empirical research investigating the economic values of user-generated-content (UGC) and marketer-generated-content (MGC) still lags. This study seeks to contribute theoretically and practically to an understanding of how online celebrity endorsement and fans interaction behaviors affect e-commerce sales. We adopt cross-sectional regression to assess the economic value of online celebrity endorsement, and we employ panel vector autoregressive model to explain the dynamic relationship between marketers’ and consumers’ content marketing behaviors and e-commerce product sales. Empirical results highlight that the interaction within fans community has spillover effect on content marketing under “Fan Economy” era.

%X Since the online agro-products information is difficult to assess, it is critical for consumers to foster consumers’ initial trust in the social commerce (s-commerce) context. On the basis of the existing research, this paper first analyzes the connotation of agro-products communication based on s-commerce. Then, it combines the inherent characteristics of agro-products, and takes the consumer characteristics as the important moderating factors, and a two-stage integration theory model based on Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Expectation Confirmation Theory (ECT) is proposed to explore the antecedent factors and the forming process of the agro-products consumer initial trust in the s-commerce environment. Finally, the further research design is simply planned for the future.

%X It is important to understand factors affecting the perceived online review helpfulness as it helps solve the problem of information overload in online shopping. Moreover, it is also crucial to explore the factors’ relative importance in predicting review helpfulness in order to effectively detect potential helpful reviews before they exert influences. Applying Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this study first investigates the effects of central cues (review subjectivity and elaborateness) and peripheral cues (reviewer rank) on review helpfulness with readability as a moderator. Second, it also explores their relative predicting power using the machine learning technique. ELM is tested in online context and the results are compared between experience and search goods. Our results provide evidence that for both types of products review subjectivity can play a more significant role when the content readability is high. Furthermore, this study reveals that the dominant predictor is varied for different product types

%X Consumers with different national culture backgrounds heavily depend upon product review to make the shopping decisions, and thus product review helpfulness significantly influences the business performance in the e-commerce context. However, prior literature neglected the heterogeneity of different national cultures, which could cause a shift in consumers’ perception towards the review helpfulness. To fill the research gap, this paper builds upon a cultural induced cognitive processing theoretical framework, the Nisbett’s analytic and holistic cognitive processing style framework, and proposes that consumers from East Asian countries and Western countries possess different cognitive processing style, thus relying on different product review features to assess product review helpfulness. Our conception is supported by an analytical investigation of a unique dataset from a major B2C shopping website in Western countries and its similar twin website in East Asian countries. Implications for researchers and practitioners are provided at the end of this paper.

%X Online deal communities where members can submit deals offered by firms and where they share information on discounted products are currently enjoying great popularity. However, studies on drivers of deal popularity in these communities are still scarce. Although deal popularity may be attributed to a large extent to the discount price, an extensive investigation of why some deals are voted more favorably than others is still lacking. Addressing this question by analyzing intrinsic and extrinsic deal quality signals, we advance knowledge in three ways. First, we enhance the understanding of the antecedents of human voting behavior in online deal communities building on signaling and social influence theory. Second, we improve the value of deal platforms by providing guidance on which factors determine the deal’s value to the community. Third, we provide a model to predict a minimum level of achievable deal popularity in the absence of community members’ votes.

%X Social networking websites (SNS) facilitate communication and information sharing between people. Media have reported significant concerns of SNS users regarding their privacy. SNS have tried to address these privacy concerns by introducing controlling features. This study investigates the issue of trust in SNS, its predictors, and its consequences. We suggest that three categories of factors should be considered for the study of social networking websites: (1) website characteristics, (2) environmental factors, and (3) personal factors. We find that trust in the website is a significant predictor of SNS information sharing. We also find that personal factors, such as privacy concerns and trust propensity and social presence, a website characteristic, are significant predictors of trust in SNS. The findings show similarities and differences between the context of e-commerce and SNS. We provide implications for research and practice as well as direction for future research.

%X This study presents a simple, theory-based method for calculating a metric which reflects the quality of online consumer reviews in mobile application markets. Derived from prior online consumer review studies based on psychology, information quality, and economics literature, a metric for measuring online consumer review quality is developed. The metric is a weighted sum of three variables (Squared Star Rating, Log-transformed Word Count, and Sum of Squared Negative and Positive Sentiment), and weights for calculating the metric are estimated by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique. Preliminary assessment of the proposed method shows that metrics computed by using the proposed method are positively correlated with helpfulness ranks of mobile application reviews in Google Play. However, PCA results show that one of the variables (i.e., sentiment) used for developing the metric did not load consistently on the first factor component. From the findings of the preliminary evaluation on the metric, limitations and future research directions of the proposed method are discussed.

%X Social media is the gathering place of a large pool of consumers. It is the repository of consumer information and acts as a means of spreading information to build market presence. Most literature states that organizational usage of social media enhances customer relations, but social media also acts as a medium for information acquisition. Not many previous studies have investigated the role of social media on information accessibility. Therefore this study examined the impact of social media on information accessibility. A total of 171 organization responded to the survey and the result of the survey showed that social media usage has a positive impact on information accessibility. Also it was found that factors such as interactivity, trust and institutional pressure positively influence social media usage in organizations. This study provided a clearer understanding on the real importance of social media and its benefits towards information acquisition. The results would motivate and guide organizations in the adoption of social media for information acquisition which is important for understanding the customers, competitors and the industry and to develop strategies for enhancing business performance.

%X Recent market developments such as increasing digitalization of services, professionalization of customers, and transparency about the specific value of IT services, are putting IT consulting firms as well as their customers under pressure. Thus, it is of high importance that IT consultancies and their customers are jointly working together to innovate new services and solve specific tasks which come along with the digitization of services. Although previous literature offers valuable starting points for explaining such collaborative value creation, we do not see specific approaches that comprehensively address this challenge. By drawing upon the service-dominant logic as the theoretical frame, we deductively develop a conceptual model that explains the emergence of co-created value within IT consulting relationships. After a thorough empirical validation of our model, our ultimate contribution will be a theory that equips IT consulting firms and their customers with information to better understand the drivers of co-created value.

%X In collaborative filtering approaches, recommendations are inferred from user data. A large volume and a high data quality is essential for an accurate and precise recommender system. As consequence, companies are collecting large amounts of personal user data. Such data is often highly sensitive and ignoring users’ privacy concerns is no option. Companies address these concerns with several risk reduction strategies, but none of them is able to guarantee cryptographic secureness. To close that gap, the present paper proposes a novel recommender system using the advantages of blockchain-supported secure multiparty computation. A potential costumer is able to allow a company to apply a recommendation algorithm without disclosing her personal data. Expected benefits are a reduction of fraud and misuse and a higher willingness to share personal data. An outlined experiment will compare users’ privacy-related behavior in the proposed recommender system with existent solutions.

%X Automobile purchase intentions of customers relate to car dealers’ costs and affect the car dealers’ marketing strategy and manufacturing process in the long term. Automobile purchase intention classification has become critically important for car dealers. In our paper, we innovatively constructed a hobby based network and a working based network of customers, and used customers’ profile of same group as inputs to the deep learning model to predict customers’ purchase intention based on community detection by social network analysis. Based on the real-world dataset, our experimental results verify that the framework with both hobby-based network and working-based network using deep learning method has best performance, which is 14% better than the baseline model. And the hobby-based network outperforms working-based network. Because of the advantage of consumer’s personality, hobbies can be used for better predicting the purchase intention. Therefore, our proposed framework is a potential tool for automobile purchase intention classification.

%X Acknowledging the high penetration rate of mobile devices, mobile payment is currently a hot topic and is expected to reach the tipping point of rapid growth. For such a nascent market, how to run a successful mobile payment platform remains unanswered. Therefore, we devote this study to investigate the pricing strategy of proximity mobile payment. Mobile payment serves as a two-sided platform connecting merchants and customers. By leveraging the emergent mobile payment knowledge, we present a game-theoretic model featuring network externality. In the short run, we find the platform will have incentives to apply “divide and conquer” strategy by subsidizing customers to adopt the mobile payment service at the beginning of the business. After the ignition, the platform then becomes profitable by charging per transaction fee from the merchants. In the long run, the subsidization strategy is suggested to be applied when the bank is not taking too much processing fee and leaves sufficient market share to the mobile payment platform. In terms of contributions to practice, this study offers a step forward of method to identify this promising market for mobile payment executives, financial institutes and all others ecosystem.

%X Consumer decision-making is usually modeled as a two-stage process of initial screening and subsequent in-depth consideration of attractive alternatives. Recent evidence indicates, however, that consideration is not necessarily the direct precursor of choice: consumers may narrow their consideration sets further to the choice set. We examine how choices in a three-stage purchase decision process evolve by observing consumer behavior in an online shopping experiment. Specifically, we examine the effects of system- and user-generated recommendations (SGR and UGR) moderated by gender. Our contribution to information systems research is threefold. First, we suggest a new experimental design for observing the stages in purchasing processes. Second, we show that effects of SGR and UGR indeed vary between stages. UGR reduce consideration set size and increase females’ choice probability while SGR reduce males’ transition probabilities. Third, our results suggest that omitting choice set formation can lead to incorrect estimates of choice probabilities.

These  affective-driven  WOM  and  cognitive-driven  acceptance  decision  are  important  to  e-services success.  In this study, we incorporate two main streams of IS research: 1)the quality of the systems in determining  systems  success  and  2)  the  effects  of  online  incidents  including  online  waiting, interruptions,  and  service  failures  on  consumer  behaviors,  to  understand  these  affective  and cognitive-driven behaviors.  We bridge the two streams of research and explain blog usage from the perspectives  of  affective  events  theory  and  social  exchange  factors.    The  research  model  posits that blog  usage  behaviors  are  determined  by  perceived  site  quality  and  cognitive  appraisal  of incidents handling  (CAIH)  and  satisfaction  mediated  the  effects  of  positive  and  negative  affects  to post-adoption  behaviors.    Results  of  partial  least  squares  analysis  with  467  responses  from  an online survey  indicate  that  all  measures  have  acceptable  psychometric  properties  and  confirmatory  factor analysis  attests  the dimensionality  of constructs.

%X Big data has received considerable attention from the information systems (IS) discipline over the past few years, with several recent commentaries, editorials, and special issue introductions on the topic appearing in leading IS outlets. These papers present varying perspectives on promising big data research topics and highlight some of the challenges that big data poses. In this editorial, we synthesize and contribute further to this discourse. We offer a first step toward an inclusive big data research agenda for IS by focusing on the interplay between big data’s characteristics, the information value chain encompassing people-process-technology, and the three dominant IS research traditions (behavioral, design, and economics of IS). We view big data as a disruption to the value chain that has widespread impacts, which include but are not limited to changing the way academics conduct scholarly work. Importantly, we critically discuss the opportunities and challenges for behavioral, design science, and economics of IS research and the emerging implications for theory and methodology arising due to big data’s disruptive effects.

%X This study contributes to investigate about the factors that can amplify the adoption rate of a given technology, by analyzing the background culture. This research investigates the acceptance of NFC enabled mobile devices through both a technological and cultural lenses. Moreover, the research focuses specifically on the case of India, a country that in spite of its evolution and differences, today has strong common roots, which makes it an ideal choice for any study related to culture. While ‘Power distance’ was found to fasten the acceptance of NFC enabled mobile devices, ‘Collectivism’ and ‘Uncertainty Avoidance’ did not result in any correlation with the attitude towards this new technology. This was mainly due to hierarchical nature of the Indian society, which creates a culture of competition between the people and encourages people to distinguish themselves from others. The show of status and wealth is prominent in the society and people are willing to purchase and invest in the latest and fashionable devices and technologies.

%X Outsourced software project is one of the main ways of software development, which is of high failure rate. Intelligent risk prediction model can help identify high risk project in time. However, the existing models are mostly based on such a hypothesis that all the cost of misclassification is equal, which is not consistent with the reality that in the domain of software project risk prediction, the cost of predicting a fail-prone project as a success-prone project is different from predicting a success-prone project as a fail-prone project. To the best of our knowledge, the cost-sensitive learning method has not yet been applied in the domain of outsourced software project risk management though it has been widely used in a variety of fields. Based on this situation, we selected five classifiers, and introduced cost-sensitive learning method to build intelligent prediction models respectively. This paper totally collected 292 real data of outsourced software project for modeling. Experiment results showed that, under cost-sensitive scenario, the polynomial kernel support vector machine is the best classifier for outsourced software project risk prediction among the five classifiers due to its high prediction accuracy, stability and low cost.

%X Private banks see great potential in digital technologies for engaging with clients. Both practitioners and researchers believe that digital technologies, such as mobile applications, increase transparency in the advisory process and consequently raise trust, satisfaction and customer loyalty. This study proposes 5 design requirements (DR) for developing trust in a mobile financial advisory service. A first prototype was designed following the proposed DR. In addition, we conduct an experimental evaluation with 34 participants and compare the prototype with email communication. The findings provide mixed results on how a mobile application, designed according to the proposed DR, could increase trust and intention to use. With regard to overall satisfaction, the app was favored over email communication.

%X Usage of social networking sites requires continuous trusting actions through the sharing of personal information. According to Social Cognitive Theory, such behavior and resulting experiences should have an impact on the beliefs that led to the behavior, namely trust. In this study, a model of how this process takes place and the results of a survey suggest that increasing usage of social networking sites increases disposition to trust, mediated by optimism, innovativeness, and trust in the social networking site. Implications of these findings are discussed.

%X Social Customer Relationship Management (SCRM) is a new paradigm to manage and engage customers via Social Media and should be treated as a holistic business strategy. Despite convincing reference cases by scholars and practitioners, there is still skepticism and reservation towards SCRM. Scholars are applying the resource-based view and the dynamic capabilities perspective for their exploratory and explanatory research to provide insights backed by these proven theories. This paper examines contemporary research and juxtaposes it to current business needs within a holistic SCRM performance dimension framework. The results are obtained through interactive research. The paper provides new and validated definitions of infrastructure and process components related to SCRM and develops propositions regarding customer-centric resources and capabilities. It further reveals research gaps within the literature regarding SCRM performance measurement and provides suggestions for further research.

%X Online consumer reviews can help customers decrease uncertainty and risk faced in online shopping. However, information overload and conflicting comments in online reviews can get consumers confused. Therefore, it is important for both researchers and practitioners to understand the characteristics of helpful reviews. But studies examining the determinants of perceived review helpfulness produce mixed findings. We review extant research about the determinant factors of perceived helpfulness. Conflicting findings exist for six review related factors, namely review extremity, review readability, review total votes, linear review rating, quadratic review rating, and review sentiment. We conduct a meta-analysis to reconcile the contradictory findings on the influence of review related factors over perceived review helpfulness. The meta-analysis results confirm that review extremity, readability, total votes, and positive sentiment have a negative influence on helpfulness, but review rating is positively related to helpfulness. We also examine those studies whose findings are contradictive with the meta-analysis results. Measure discrepancy and reviewed product type are the two main reasons why mixed findings exist in extant research.

%X In this study, we analyzed consumer Internet behavior in India since there were several unique cultural dimensions of interest.  After reviewing the literature, we tested hypotheses that demographic and psychological factors such as happiness, excitement, satisfaction, positive feelings, pleasant feelings, gender, age, and income level could predict consumer Internet purchase behavior.  We used Spearman correlation, binary logistic regression, and discriminant analysis techniques, which resulted in effect sizes ranging from 9.5% to 59.5%.  Spearman correlation confirmed that gender, age, and income level were related to consumer Internet purchase behavior.  Several binary logistic regression models with goodness-of-fit-tests revealed that all satisfaction, happiness, positive feelings and pleasant feelings, but not excitement, could predict consumer Internet purchase intention.  A Discriminant Analysis model was able to correctly classify 87.3% of the sample respondents using two factors, and a second model with only one factor correctly categorized 90.5% of the consumers as willing to purchase on the Internet.

%X With the fast development of online social media, social network services have become an important research area nowadays. We are now in the era of social colonization, in which technologies such as Facebook Connect and Google Friend Connect have standardized social functionalities among a vast majority of websites. Particularly, microblog as a new star needs more attention. Although most of current studies have focused on the effect of social network on the diffusion of services or information, usually those studies are descriptions or explanations of what already has happened. Limited study has been conducted focusing on SNS users and analysing their behaviours dynamically. In this paper, we used probability models such as Pareto/NBD and BG/NBD to predict customer lifetime vitality. The data we used include information on users’ tweet and retweet behaviour, such as recency and frequency. Our results showed that both Pareto/NBD model and BG/NBD model showed effective ability to fit and predict SNS users’ usage behaviour on microblog website. Tweet behaviors are more suitable for such probability models than retweet behaviors. Managerial implications of the two models should be highlighted as well. Interaction rate and dropout rate can be considered as the vitality index of the whole user base measuring how active users are and how likely a user is active. Managerial questions such as how active the users are in this platform now and how active the users will be in the future can be answered by applying those models.

%X There is growing debate about whether companies’ investments in social media really pay off. This research attempts to contribute to this discussion by investigating the relationship between a firm’s social media activity and two outcomes, namely, company reputation and firm financial performance. Two propositions are developed based on theory and tested with a sample of 59 companies. The findings suggest that a firm’s social media activity is only partially linked with its financial performance and is not linked with corporate reputation. The implications of the research suggest that little is known about the relationships between a firm’s social media activity and corporate reputation and financial outcomes.

%X Social commerce, the combination of e-commerce activities and social media, is a lucrative means for e-commerce companies to increase their sales volumes. As social commerce initiatives considerably depend on the consumers’ social interactions, it becomes important for companies to understand how consumers can be stimulated to participate in social commerce. While several empirical studies have already focused on investigating what factors influence consumers to adopt to social commerce, the findings of these studies are scattered across the literature base, sometimes not transparent, and not straightforwardly comparable. To synthesize these findings, we conduct a systematic review of the empirical literature on the consumers’ adoption of social commerce. In particular, we identify and classify conceptually similar factors and outcome variables (i.e., behavioral intentions and/or behaviors). Moreover, we apply a vote-counting technique and a sign test to aggregate the reported effects between the factors and outcome variables. After analyzing 61 academic publications, we contribute a structured and comprehensive list of factors and their potential effects on various adoption-related outcome variables. Our results reveal that for some factors, such as trust, usefulness, or social influence, the effects point in a clear direction, while for several other factors, such as enjoyment, risk, or social presence, the effects are yet not clear and require further investigations.

%X Mobile phones have become an integral part of a vast majority of people’s daily lives. It is becoming rare to conduct any form of communication between individuals without a mobile phone. Research continues on the integration of mobile phones and e-commerce solutions. Developed countries already use systems for such commercial transactions however developing countries, for example those in the Caribbean, face challenges in adopting such systems. This paper proposes a system that would allow users to carry out financial transactions with their mobile phones as well as manage their financial activities. The system, which we call PayPhone, allows customers in developing countries to pay for items by tapping their phone against a terminal that supports Near-Field Communications (NFC). The system is compared to other systems such as the debit card based system, LINX, in the Caribbean and other systems in developing and developed countries. We also explore and discuss other possible short-range technology options.

%X It is a common problem for companies to sustain high levels of customer satisfaction in social media where customer opinions and attitudes propagate through a large population quickly. The value of customer participation has been emphasized in order to improve the information exchanging between customers and companies. Value co-creation is one of the most important ways to achieve that goal; and resources are the key issues towards value co-creation processes. To enhance competition power and improve the customer satisfaction, companies must have a deep insight of value co-creation, especially from the perspective of resources. In this paper, a resource mapping framework in social media has been given based on the value co-creation theory. The value co-creation processes have been split into three sub-processes: company resource-mapping processes, customer resource-mapping processes and encounter resource-mapping processes. At last, an instance has been analyzed to prove the proposed framework applicability.

The emergence of digital technologies enables, among other things, new business models and therefore, obviously constitutes an industry transformation potential. However, IS research that actually deals with digitally enabled industry transformation is still rare. Motivated by its IT intensive nature, the research focus of this paper lies within the financial service industry. Prior research that deals with individual units or sectors is synthesized with the aim to draw inference on the financial service industry. The identified research articles are categorized into business, customer and technology relationship. The results include that digital technologies enables new business models, cause (dis)intermediation and customer centricity becomes increasingly important for financial service providers. Additionally, the interaction between user and technology changes and information is increasingly digitized. Finally, possible future research questions are named.

Social media and social networks use in commerce has become ubiquitous and is changing the way we communicate, market, sell, and trade (Boyd and Ellison, 2007). The popularity of social networking sites (SNSs) and the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies have brought new developments in e-commerce, which enable individuals to interact with their peers in online communities via social platforms (Liang & Turban, 2011). The social connections and interactions of individuals on the Internet, especially in SNSs, have enabled the expansion of e-commerce to include social commerce (Zeng et al., 2009).

%X This study explores the emerging phenomenon of collaborative online shopping by comparing three navigation support designs: separate navigation with location cue, split screen navigation, and tightly-bonded shared navigation. The impacts of the three navigation support designs on collaborative customers’ actual and perceived shared understanding were investigated in a laboratory experiment. The moderating effect of shopping group structure was also examined. The experimental results show that (1) split screen navigation leads to more actual shared understanding than separate navigation with location cue; (2) tightly-bonded shared navigation leads to less perceived shared understanding than split screen navigation; (3) in terms of actual shared understanding, the superiority of split screen navigation over tightly-bonded shared navigation is less prominent for customers in co-buyers structure than for those in buyer/advisor structure. The results also indicate that perceived shared understanding influences the perceived decision quality, which further affects customers’ intentions to revisit the online store.

We employ a promising research approach, based on the event study methodology, and use a rich database consisting of all the promotional events on Twitter by American Express Company and its participating partners. Based on the results of the presented econometric analysis and focusing on the long-term business value of this novel use of social media, we find that promotional events combined with implicit or explicit advocacy on social media platforms result in significant abnormal returns for the participating brand, in terms of fan base and new followers on the social media platform. Finally, we both contribute to the related literature, discovering new rich findings, and provide actionable insights with major implications for brands, marketers, and social media platforms.

%X Social networking platforms, such as WeChat and Facebook, increasingly become an important channel for advertising and transaction. Despite the growing importance of social network in facilitating social commerce, there has been limited research focusing on the dynamic implicit communities within the social network. This paper proposes a framework for gathering business intelligence from one popular social media platform in China (WeChat) by collecting and analyzing social network contents and consumer’s interaction networks. It is one of the first studies to our knowledge that identifies and analyzes implicit communities from social media platform for social commerce. We conduct case studies in a relationship-based online social group of WeChat. We first extract and analyze implicit communities, representing interactions among users and product vendors, from a large dataset. This is then combined with interaction-based content analysis to identify position of product vendors from these identified implicit communities. After examining the influence of network properties and community structures on consumer’s purchase, we propose a chat log-based content analysis to identify product-related information (including product attribute information, user experience information, social support information, and entertainment information). Finally, by combining those information and network structure, we build weighted implicit communities and calculate the influence of these weighted implicit communities on product vendors’ income. Our case studies demonstrate how to use the framework and appropriate techniques to effectively collect, extract, and analyze implicit communities related to the topics of interest, reveal novel patterns in the interactions and communities, and answer important business intelligence questions in the domains.

%X The paper proposes a unified risk-benefit analysis framework for investigating consumers’ adoption of mobile payment technology. Based on perceived risk theory and risk-benefit analysis literature, the proposed framework integrates three variables—perceived risk, perceived benefit and perceived value, to predict consumers’ intention to use mobile payment. All the proposed hypotheses are well supported based on an empirical validation of 336 useful survey samples. The results show that consumers consider both the beneficial and risky aspects of using mobile payment to evaluate the overall desirability (perceived value) of adoption decision. Further, perceived value, together with perceived risk and benefit directly affects consumers’ intention to adopt the technology. Financial risk is found to be the key resource of the risks of using mobile payment. Both theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

The current study categorizes electronic financial services provided by banks into transaction-oriented services (TOS) and communication-oriented services (COS), in order to investigate the co-value creation phenomenon through customer participation. It is assumed that the antecedent variables in the previous studies may exert differential effects on the use behaviour of electronic services. The proposed model includes three Technology Readiness dimensions (discomfort, optimism, and insecurity), and two Technology acceptance constructs (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness), as the antecedents to use of e-banking services. The proposed research model was tested against the data collected through a survey of service users who have experience with both TOS use and COS use.
%X The key result is that the use behaviour of the different types of e-banking services is affected by different sets of factors: the use of TOS is found to be affected by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and insecurity; whereas the use of COS is affected only by perceived ease of use.

%X In the competitive market of B2B e-commerce website, as customer switching cost and network externality could prevent customers to switch to later entrant, the earlier entrant has the advantage to build and retain its market share. However, the declining cost of information technology (IT) over time provides the later entrant a cost advantage. In order to maintain competitive advantage, what should the earlier and later entrant’s investment strategies be in the presence of customer switching costs, network externalities, and declining IT cost? To analyze this question, considering these three factors, the paper develops IT investment strategy model of a duopoly with sequential entry and discusses the impact of these three factors on IT investment strategy. The results show that, with the declining IT cost, the early entrant may increase its investment in quality, assume an aggressive investment strategy when switching cost is high, otherwise, the later entrant may increase its investment in quality, assume an aggressive investment strategy, and could offer a higher-quality system and capture a higher market share when switching cost is low. With the increase in network externality intensity, the early entrant may increase its investment in quality, assume an aggressive investment strategy, and the later entrant may decrease its investment in quality, assume a defensive investment strategy.

This study extended research on digital inequality to the field of mobile business. The paper aimed to investigate the impact of digital inequality in the use of mobile business supporting features in China. To address this, an empirical study with 258 subjects was carried out. The results indicated that perceived ease of use had a significant positive effect on the use of mobile business supporting features, while perceived risk had a significant negative effect on the use of mobile business supporting features. Furthermore, this study also revealed that socio-economically disadvantaged individuals were more likely to be influenced by perceived risks, while socio-economically advantaged individuals were more likely to be influenced by the utilitarian motivations.

%X Predicting technological innovations in financial information systems (IS) and technology ecosystems has been challenging for technology forecasters and industry analysts due to their underlying complexity. Technology-based financial innovations over the past four decades, such as programmed trading in the 1980s, risk-adjusted return on capital-based financial risk management systems in the 1990s, high-frequency trading and Internet banking in 2000s, and now mobile payments in the 2010s, have all led to transformations in the financial services industry. What basis can be identified to predict such new innovations? And what areas of financial services will they affect? This study applies the technology ecosystem approach, extended to incorporate stakeholders’ strategic actions, to analyse the paths of influence for mobile payment technologies. Our ecosystem model brings together three core elements: emerging technology components, technology-based services, and technologysupported business infrastructure. We will also discuss its applicability to high-frequency trading in the equity markets.

%X There have been repeated calls for studies in behavioral science and human-computer interaction (HCI) research to measure participants’ actual behaviors. HCI research studies often use multiple constructs as perceived measures of behavior, which are captured using participants’ self-reports on surveys. Response biases, however, are a widespread threat to the validity of self-report measures. To mitigate this threat to validity, we propose that studies in HCI measure actual behaviors in appropriate contexts rather than solely perceptions. We report an example of using movements that reflect both actual behavior and behavioral changes measured within a health care IS usage context, specifically the detection and alleviation of neuromuscular degenerative disease. We propose and test a method of monitoring mouse-cursor movements to detect hand tremors in real time when individuals are using websites. Our work suggests that analyzing hand movements as an actual (rather than perceptual) measure of usage could enrich other areas of IS research (e.g., technology acceptance, efficacy, fear, etc.), in which perceptions of states and behavior are measured post hoc to the interaction and subject to the threats of various forms of response bias.

%X Research has consistently shown that online word-of-mouth (WOM) plays an important role in shaping customer attitudes and behaviors. Yet, despite their documented utility, explicit user scores, such as star ratings have limitations in certain contexts. Automatic sentiment analysis (SA), an analytics technique that assesses the “tone” of text, has been proposed as a way to deal with these shortcomings. While extant research on SA has focused on issues surrounding the design of algorithms and output accuracy, this research-in-progress examines the behavioral and interface design issues in regards to SA scores as perceived by their intended users. Specifically, in an online context, we experimentally investigate the role of product (product category) and review characteristics (review extremity) in influencing the perceived usefulness of SA scores. Further, we investigate whether variations in how the SA scores are presented to the user, and the nature of the scores themselves further affect user perceptions.

%X Many online stores apply several sales support systems, e.g., recommender systems, sorting and filtering tools, to support buyers during the shopping process. Although, the research highlights the positive effect of such systems, the current study questions its applicability in online stores for products which serve users' needs to be unique like apparel or luxury products. We analyze female users' buying behavior of apparel products in a laboratory setting and find that users with high trendiness undertake in general more search steps. Further, we find that most users rely during their search process on different sorting and filtering as well as on keyword search tools while personalized and non-personalized recommendations play a minor role for users in this industry. Further, we find that users with high trendiness avoid following top seller lists and "wear with it"-recommendations. Moreover, the provision of top seller rankings does not influence the consumers' product choice.

%X The transformation of traditional offline operations into digitally integrated offline-online environment has been a difficult challenge for firms from both operational and strategic perspectives, and has become a major topic of research for scholars. We conducted a comparative case study to explore an emerging trend – the convergence of offline and online operations and strategies. This study extends disruptive innovation theory by emphasizing the interactive effect between firms and customers on organizational innovation in the ecommerce environment. We demonstrate that treating online ecommerce as a channel innovation is an essential problem that pushes many traditional firms into a transformational dilemma. We further explore two successful transformational paths and strategies used by our case firms: the resource-complement sustaining renewal and the resource-substitute disruptive renewal. This study provides a theoretical understanding and a practical guide to firms that transform from traditional offline mode to digital online/offline mode.

However, there are several groups within societies that are missing out on government benefits due to no online access or/and knowledge, including the elderly. This research attempts to understand the factors affecting older adults’ adoption and use of e-government in a vicinity of Saudi Arabia. To achieve this, a quantitative method used an online survey questionnaire resulting in 937 completed responses. The findings offer implications for existing literature on e-Government adoption, for practitioners and policy makers.

%X Social Customer Relationship Management (Social CRM) deals with the integration of Web 2.0 and Social Media into CRM. Social CRM is a business strategy supported by technology platforms in order to provide mutually beneficial value for both companies and customers. Gartner has identified Social CRM as one of the top innovation-triggered themes in 2013 [1]. In this context, a constraining factor regarding the implementation of Social CRM and the achievement of its objectives is the lack of an appropriate performance measurement model. Little research has been conducted on the relevant performance factors and Social CRM performance measurement models. To address this gap, the article presents the qualitative part of a two-stage multi-method approach. It comprises findings from a literature review, 15 semi-structured interviews and a consolidation procedure. A preliminary Social CRM performance measurement model is developed containing four performance dimensions, 25 classified Social CRM performance factors and corresponding performance measures.

%X Undisputedly, the amount of data is growing exponentially and huge opportunities exist to exploit them. New service business models are being built around value propositions based on data and analytics.  Suitable revenue models need to reap the benefits of these value propositions. However, the question of how to best turn a value proposition into revenue for data-driven services is not systematically addressed in literature. \  \ We provide an overview of possible revenue models for data-driven services. Based on a sample of 100 start-ups, we apply qualitative analysis to identify different revenue models for newly established data-driven services such as subscription, gain sharing and multi-sided revenue models.  \  \ This paper will contribute to the fundamental understanding of how companies can capture value from data-driven services. It should give guidance on the design and selection of appropriate revenue models and, thus, inspire new forms of revenue generation from the use of data. \

%X The process of the trust production and transfer is both stochastic and rational. In this article, we analyze the characters of this process in consumer’s social networks, by dividing consumers and merchants into two types: Risk-aversion type and Risk-neutral type for consumers, high-grade and low-grade for merchants respectively. Based on multi-agent NETLogo system, three kinds of virtual social networks are constructed, which are the risk-neutral without institution, risk-aversion without institution, risk-aversion but with good institution. The rules of the production and transfer of trust in consumer-to-consumer and merchant-to-consumers are defined. Based on a series of computational experiments and statistical comparison, we draw a conclusion that the characters of consumers do not change the trend of e-business market scale, but only change the equilibrium value. On the other hand, a risk-aversion with good institutional society can boost market to have a highly upward trend and be self-stable. Consequentially, this article indirectly proved of the essentials for establishing the institution-based trust.

%X Wixom and Todd (2005) integrated the user satisfaction and the technology acceptance literatures to theorize about and account for the influence of the information technology artifact on usage.  Based on Wixom and Todd’s integrated model of technology usage, we propose the 3Q model by investigating the role of service quality (SQ), in addition to system quality (SysQ) and information quality (IQ), in website adoption.  Attention to SQ is critical, as consumer websites have increasingly become the target of SQ assessment made by consumers, not just traditional SysQ and IQ evaluations.  As part of our study, we further theorize and empirically test the relationships among these three types of quality constructs and hypothesize that perceived SysQ influences perceived IQ and perceived SQ, and perceived IQ influences perceived SQ.  Our study extends the Wixom and Todd model in the e-service context and is the first of its kind to empirically examine the combined impact of perceived SQ, perceived SysQ, and perceived IQ on usage intention.  Our study advances the theoretical understanding of SQ and the relationships among perceptions of SysQ, IQ, and SQ in the e-service context.  The results also inform practitioners that high IQ and SysQ can directly or indirectly improve SQ in the e-service context.

%X Online consumer review plays an important role in customers’ purchase decisions. However, conflicting online reviews can confuse potential customers. As a result, he/she will take a risk of either selecting a product that is not able to satisfy their needs or not select an appropriate product. This error in purchasing can impose significant tangible and intangible costs on the supply chain. In this paper, a conceptual framework will be proposed to model the effect of three types of conflict among online consumer reviews: including Conflicting opinions among product attributes, Conflicting star ratings and the Disagreement intensity among reviewers (CCD model) on the perceived informativeness and accuracy of a purchase decision. Result of this study may help sellers to analyze and categorize online reviews and publish reviews that would improve the accuracy of a purchase decision, thereby decreasing the overall cost of a wrong purchase.

%X The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether demographic characteristics influence user attitude towards mobile banking. Although earlier studies on technology adoption have received considerable empirical validation, most of the studies did not consider moderating variables. Among those which consider moderating variables, primarily explored are gender, age and income. By including other moderator variables in the model, we hope to lessen the inconsistencies found in past research studies. Two methods, viz. multiple linear regression and Fisher Z transformation have been used to test the moderating effects. The sample comprise of users of online banking in India. Results show that gender, age, qualification, experience, occupation, income and marital status were significant moderating variables. However, educational background did not show any moderating effect. Our results suggest that by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) theory, the research provide insights into the moderating effect of demographics.

%X Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) are online consumer-generated communications that are expected to affect consumers’ perceptions of adopting online services. While adoption of an online service consists of pre and post-usage stages, much of literature implicitly assumes that the effectiveness of positive/negative eWOM is the same across the two stages. In this paper, we draw on the accessibility-diagnosticity model and elaboration likelihood model to show that the effectiveness of eWOM on consumers’ perceptions of adopting experience services is contingent on: (1) the stage of the service adoption, (2) consumers’ prior experience with the context of the eWOM communications, and (3) the eWOM communications framing (i.e., positive and negative). Our findings explain that the confluence of aforementioned factors determines the effectiveness of eWOM communications.

%X Post adoption behaviours of e-service users are important for e-service providers to increase both their revenues and profits. WOM, as an important post adoption behavior, have not received the attention of IS researchers. The current paper develops a model to investigate the factors influencing individual e-service users’ Word of Mouth (WOM) behavior. Based on 543 useful questionnaires, the research model is empirically tested together with a number of hypotheses. The results show that satisfaction together with perceived usefulness and service quality positively impact users’ recommendations of e-service to others. The study finding implies that individuals would like to spread WOM more based on e-service attributes and service performance than on their own affect. Finally, the implications to theories and practice are discussed as well.

%X Interpersonal fraud is a complex social action constituted by a series of dependent events and an accurate representation of this interaction requires the examination of both the victim and perpetrator in fraudulent exchanges. IS domain research on e-commerce provides behavioral models that can be used to describe a victim’s perspective on fraud in online commerce. Similarly, research in the accounting domain has developed the fraud triangle, a behavioral model that describes a perpetrator’s perspective in committing fraud. There is limited research exploring how the use of technology affects fraudulent behaviors despite a growing interest in studying computer mediated deception. We draw on research from the IS and accounting domains about the fraud triangle, e-commerce, and computer-mediated deception to develop a two-sided model that combines victim and perpetrator behaviors. The proposed model more accurately depicts the complex nature of the social exchanges between fraud victims and perpetrators that result in fraud.

An emerging application is to inform organisations of potential fraudulent behaviour, which results in reducing online fraud and its associated costs. This paper introduces a case study in which social fingerprinting is used as a big data profile-based fraud detection technique for e-commerce transactions. Through an analysis of semi-structured interviews, this research in progress identifies three information processing capabilities based on social fingerprinting that a business must develop to eliminate fraud. Further interviews and analysis are proposed in order to have a better understanding of how social fingerprinting can be used in e-commerce. By uncovering interrelationships of social fingerprinting as online fraud detection solution, this study will provide significant contribution to information processing and analytic theory and practice.

Our study was conducted in two steps: qualitative and quantitative research. As a first step, we conducted interviews with the directors of the two platforms. As the second step, we conducted user survey to assess the user perception of platform governance strategies. The preliminary finding from our interview with the operators of two major C2C marketplaces shows that the both operators acknowledge an effective governance system as the key factor of success, but adopt different approaches to ensure effectiveness. Two different strategies for platform governance are adopted: proactive and reactive. The preliminary finding from our user survey indicates that users perceive a reactive strategy as more effective compared to a proactive strategy.

%X With an abundance of products available online, many online retailers provide sales rankings to make it easier for consumers to find the best-selling products.  Successfully implementing product rankings online was done a decade ago by Amazon, and more recently by Apple’s App Store.  However, neither market provides actual download data, a very useful statistic for both practitioners and researchers.  In the past, researchers developed various strategies that allowed them to infer demand from rank data.  Almost all of that work is based on an experiment that shifts sales or collaboration with a vendor to get actual sales data.  In this research, we present an innovative method to use public data to infer the rank–demand relationship for the paid apps on Apple’s iTunes App Store.  We find that the top-ranked paid app for iPhone generates 150 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200.  Similarly, the top paid app on iPad generates 120 times more downloads compared to the paid app ranked at 200.  We conclude with a discussion on an extension of this framework to the Android platform, in-app purchases, and free apps.

%X Business intelligence (BI), “big data”, and analytics solutions are being deployed in an increasing number of organizations, yet recent predictions point to severe shortages in the number of graduates prepared to work in the area. New model curriculum is needed that can properly introduce BI and analytics topics into existing curriculum. That curriculum needs to incorporate current big data developments even as new dedicated analytics programs are becoming more prominent throughout the world. This paper contributes to the BI field by providing the first BI model curriculum guidelines. It focuses on adding appropriate elective courses to existing curriculum in order to foster the development of BI skills, knowledge, and experience for undergraduate majors, master of science in business information systems degree students, and MBAs. New curricula must achieve a delicate balance between a topic’s level of coverage that is appropriate to students’ level of expertise and background, and it must reflect industry workforce needs. Our approach to model curriculum development for business intelligence courses follows the structure of Krathwohl’s (2002) revised taxonomy, and we incorporated multi-level feedback from faculty and industry experts. Overall, this was a long-term effort that resulted in model curriculum guidelines.

%X Drawing upon the social capital theory (SCT), this study integrates social capital factors with the perspectives of consumer hedonic participation and platform capability of online group buying sites to explore how they af ect consumer value creation toward online group buying (OGB). Data from 663 valid responses were obtained using an online large-scale survey. The conceptual framework was validated by using the partial least squares (PLS) technique. The research findings show that 1) the consumers’ value created by engaging in OGB is contributed collectively by social capital factors (i.e., social interaction tie, trust, and shared value), hedonic participation and OGB platform capabilities; 2) the social capital enhances consumers’ value creation by increasing their hedonic participation; 3) The OGB platform capabilities has a positive impact on social capital, hedonic participation and value creation. The proposed research model explains 64.1 % of variance for consumers’ value creation, 52.6 % of variance for their hedonic participation and 46.1% of variance for social capital in OGB. Our findings provide insights into how OGB administrators can govern OGB initiatives to expand OGB members’ social capital and OGB platform capability, thereby leading to ef ective consumer value creation.

This study divides consumer perceived risks of online payment into eight dimensions: Economic risk, Functional risk, Private risk, Security risk, Time risk, Service risk, Psychological risk and Social risk. Furthermore, it explores the influence of multi-dimensional perceived risks on the willingness of consumers’ online payment on the basis of 616 samples from Shanghai. The empirical results show that there is a significant negative correlation between perceived economic risks and the willingness to pay online; perceived security risks and some other risks have significant positive effect on payment willingness, which shows that certain perceived risks are becoming systemic risks in accordance with the principle of finance. So, the paper imply that both Private and Government third payment platforms shall take certain measures to reduce consumers’ specific perceived risk for promoting the development of online transaction market in China.

%X Numerous studies have shown that social media marketing strategies have positive impacts on the long-term financial performance of firms. However, whether short-term marketing campaigns have any influence on firm revenue remains unknown. This paper examines data from Singles’ Day, the world’s largest shopping event, revealing that firms’ social media efforts have a positive impact on product sales. Furthermore, we find that the two social media effort measures generally thought to have positive impacts on a firm’s long-term financial performance, richness and intensity, have no significant influence on the success of a firm’s short-term marketing campaign. Instead, relevance shows significant and positive impacts. Moreover, we compare the effects of social media marketing yields from company-owned accounts with those of employee-owned accounts, finding that employee-owned accounts have better marketing effects than company-owned ones.

%X An item offered in the buy-it-now offer (BINO) format is sold to the first consumer who is willing to pay the asked price. The "lifetime" of a BINO, therefore, depends on how many consumers are interested in the item and on how much they value it. In this paper, we model this dependency by combining survival analysis and auction theory. Our model enables sellers to quantify consumer interest and consumer valuation for their items from observing BINO lifetimes only. Further, the influence of covariates (e.g., the item condition) can be investigated. To demonstrate this, we apply our model to a dataset that we have collected from eBay. The dataset consists of 1,821 BINOs of a single product, the iPhone 5S. For this example, we find a new item to attract, on average, 1.26 consumers per day, who have a mean valuation of 384.97 EUR.

Our study focuses on the initial online trust building for brick-and-click companies. Building upon social learning theory, we propose a framework to examine the learning processes and important antecedents to online trust building. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply it to the initial online trust building for brick-and-click firms. Our results suggest that the social learning theory is a viable tool to understand customer’s trust building process. Based on the effective learning processes identified for trust building, firms can allocate their resource accordingly.

Specifically, the panel focuses on three key questions at the nexus of data science, skills, and IS: a) characterizing the changes in skill demand from industry in a variety of global economic contexts, b) evaluating the role of IS departments in educating the next generation of these workers, and c) identifying how IS research should adjust to complement new educational initiatives. These questions are provocative because they are rooted in a debate about whether industry investment in modern data technologies requires new workers and skills, new courses and faculty, and a new knowledge base, or whether data science is best understood as a rebranded phenomenon that will be rapidly and effectively absorbed into existing infrastructure.

Our key identification strategy hinges on a natural experiment that took place on TripAdvisor.com that allows us to identify the causal effect with a difference-in-difference approach. Our key findings, first show that consumers’ ratings for the same restaurants are significantly higher in TripAdvisor after its adoption of the multidimensional rating system. Second, we show that restaurants with lower price level benefit more from rating system change. Third, we show that the ratings in single-dimensional rating system are similar to the lowest dimension in the multi-dimensional system. The results demonstrate the information value of multi-dimensional ratings. Our study provides important implications for a better design of online WOM systems to help consumers match their preferences with product/service attributes.

%X Consumers often view online consumer product review as a main channel for obtaining product quality information. Existing studies on product review sentiment analysis usually focus on identifying sentiments of individual reviews as a whole, which may not be effective and helpful for consumers when purchase decisions depend on specific features of products. This study proposes a new feature-level sentiment analysis approach for online product reviews. The proposed method uses an extended PageRank algorithm to extract product features and construct expandable context-dependent sentiment lexicons. Moreover, consumers’ sentiment inclinations toward product features expressed in each review can be derived based on term dependency relationships. The empirical evaluation using consumer reviews of two different products shows a higher level of effectiveness of the proposed method for sentiment analysis in comparison to two existing methods. This study provides new research and practical insights on the analysis of online consumer product reviews.

%X Companies use Facebook fan pages to promote their products or services. Recent research shows that user- (UGC) and marketer-generated content (MGC) created on fan pages affect online sales. But it is still unclear how exactly they affect consumers during their purchase process. We analyze field data from a large German e-tailer to investigate the effects of UGC and MGC in a multi-stage model of purchase decision processes: awareness creation, interest stimulation, and final purchase decision. We find that MGC and UGC create awareness by attracting users to the fan page. Increased numbers of active users stimulate user interest, and more users visit the e-tailer’s online shop. Neutral UGC increase the conversion rate of online shop visitors. Comparisons between one-, two- and three-stage modes show that neglecting one or two stages hides several important effects of MGC and UGC on consumers and ultimately leads to inaccurate predictions of key business figures.

%X For 25 years we have watched and nurtured the growth of B2C eCommerce with first time consumers, however consumer surveys are indicating that we are losing ground with previous customers who are vowing not to return. Consumers state that they perceive a lack of confidence and trust that the vendor will provide a safe and secure environment. In the early stages of development much research into trust was undertaken with many models developed to encourage consumers to be adopters of online commerce. Maintenance of trust now appears to be diminishing and it is time to consider the original motivations. This paper assembles much of the previous research in the areas of technology acceptance, personal needs and discipline specific understandings of trust and how they relate to eCommerce in an attempt to get back to basics in trust relationships and understanding of human needs.

%X Although consumer opportunistic behavior has drawn attention from managers and scholars for a long time, a special context of two-sided market has been ignored. A multi-stage research program, comprising in depth interviews (Study 1) and three experimental studies (Studies 2, 3, 4), explored opportunistic claiming during service guarantee. The main characteristics of two-sided market (consumer, platform and reference group) are considered in this paper. The findings are as follows: 1) consumers with higher level of Machiavellianism are more likely to claim in an opportunistic manner. 2) The reasonable compensation would evoke the desire for cheating behavior for Low Machs, while reduce the probability of opportunistic claiming behavior for High Machs. Both platform attitude and reference group only have significant effects on Low Machs. Specifically, 3) platform with tolerant attitude would face to more opportunistic claims and 4) reference group’s opportunistic manners would misguide others to do so.

By using the experimental method, this study analyzes the impact of product information, dimension of negative online reviews on purchase intention and the moderating role of product type. Results suggest that (1) the product information dimension of the negative online reviews has a significant effect on purchase intention, but (2) product type has no significant moderating effect between them.

%X We discuss an alternative logistics concept for e-grocery operations using an urban network of refrigerated grocery lockers. Regarding the last mile delivery of food and other fast-moving consumer goods, customers either collect their orders by themselves or the products are delivered by means of electric cargo bicycles. To determine the optimal grocery locker locations and both, the routes from the lockers to the consumers as well as the routes from the depot to the grocery lockers, we propose a 2-echelon optimization model minimizing total costs. We present a Location Routing Problem (LRP) in combination with a customized Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). With our decision support system (DSS), we react to the call of Malhotra et al. (2013) and Gholami et al. (2016) and address the lack of solution-oriented research. We contribute to the Green IS domain by extending the concept of e-grocery with an environmental and social component.

%X This study proposes a model to investigate ‘friends’ and ‘likes’ on social networking sites (SNSs) as signals of product quality and the moderating effects of product risk and product familiarity. The results indicate that ‘friends’ and ‘likes’ influence consumers’ perceptions of product quality, which subsequently affect purchase intentions. Product risk and product familiarity moderate the effect of ‘friends’ on consumers’ perceptions of product quality. Considering high product risk and low product familiarity, recommendations provided by friends are more influential than recommendations provided by friends of friends (derived friends). However, considering low product risk and high product familiarity, recommendations provided by friends or derived friends are similarly influential. In addition, the influences of the total number of ‘likes’ on product quality was similar for different levels of product risk or product familiarity.

We establish a decision-making model for the closed-loop supply chain which consists a loss averse retailer and a loss averse manufacturer. Through the analysis of this model under both centralized and decentralized closed-loop supply chain, we show how the characteristic of loss aversion affect optimal order quantity and optimal wholesale price respectively, and display the relationship between recycling price and loss aversion coefficient. In the last part of the model analysis, we give the conditions which can realize perfect coordination of the closed-loop supply chain. Finally, we give a numerical example to verify all the conclusions we obtain.

%X This study investigates the joint influences of geographical distance, social distance and travel service on online ratings in the group tour product sector. Based on 345,353 Tuniu.com reviews of 137 destination cities, we empirically find that both geographical and social distance significantly affect online word of mouth. Geographical distance has a negative effect on rating. When the quality of physical services such as schedule, catering and hotel accommodation is improved, the negative effect will be mediated. Interestingly, after controlling for the effect of geographical distance, social distance has a positive effect on rating. That is, compared with travelers from socially different cities, travelers who are socially similar are pickier. When the quality of travel service is improved, simulational fluency reducing the psychological distance, and the positive effect of social distance on travel rating is also reduced.

%X Customer self-service technologies (SST) have been gaining increasing economic importance given their proliferation in the customer service industry. Self-service kiosks have gradually been replacing traditional service employees and their progress is expected to continue. The growing relevance of SST results in the need for companies to understand why customers are willing to use SST and which motivations drive SST adoption. Two central constructs determine a customer’s willingness to use SST, namely utilitarian and hedonic value. Thus, the aim of this paper is twofold: first, we explore the multidimensional nature of utilitarian and especially hedonic value. Second, we examine their relative importance in determining repeat use intention, depending on a customer’s prior experience with SST. We develop a research model based on means-end chain (MEC) theory. The results underline that both values positively influence repeat use intention of SST. While hedonic value is prevalent for customers with little experience, utilitarian value weights stronger for customers with more experience.

%X Online platforms are prone to abuse and manipulation from strategic parties. For example, social media and review websites suﬀer from the presence of opinion spam and fake reviews. Applying the economic concept of rational expectation equilibrium (REE), we explore the impact of manipulation on consumer welfare in a Twitter-like environment. We argue that the REE outcome can be decomposed into a ﬁrm-centric effect and a rational expectation eﬀect, and the relative strength of these eﬀects determines the ﬁnal level of manipulation. We also examine the eﬀect of competition on ﬁrms’ manipulation levels. We find that the combination of a competition eﬀect and a rational expectation eﬀect determines the overall eﬀect of competition on strategic manipulation. This research sheds light on the reliability of opinion mining, and contributes to our understanding of strategic manipulation in the context of sentiment analysis.

%X With the increasing importance of mass-market information systems (IS), understanding individual user preferences for IS design and adoption is essential. However, this has been a challenging task due to the complexity of balancing functional, non-functional, and economic requirements. Conjoint analysis (CA), a marketing research technique, estimates user preferences by measuring tradeoffs between products attributes. Although the number of studies applying CA in IS has increased in the past years, we still lack fundamental discussion on its use in our discipline. We review the existing CA studies in IS with regard to the application areas and methodological choices along the CA procedure. Based on this review, we develop a reference framework for application areas in IS that serves as foundation for future studies. We argue that CA can be leveraged in requirements management, business model design, and systems evaluation. As future research opportunities, we see domain-specific adaptations e.g., user preference models.

Nonetheless, few research has looked in-depth the value of these content beyond marketing purposes. Considering the increasing variety of content that users can produce and the ease of distribution, the content industry has long been adapting to the disruptions, realizing that these self-generated contents can bring challenging management issues. This paper offers an analysis of the recent emergence of digital celebrities, or Wanghong in China. By adopting value co-creation as the theoretical lens, this study aims to 1) expand the contemporary understanding of UGC as the core product of digital content industry, shedding light on the economic value of self-generated content as part of creative and cultural industry, 2) articulate the evolution of the user-generated digital content ecosystem, providing an actionable view of ecosystem strategy.

%X Service quality becomes the key bottleneck of the adoption of G2B e-government services. In this context, control is an important tool for e-government service providers to direct and coordinate the service process. Based on the control theory, we develop a conceptual model to understand how different control initiatives influence the service quality of G2B e-government services. A multi-method analysis combining qualitative and quantitative analysis was used to conduct the study. Through a case study of a typical G2B service provider, we identified important components of input control and process control and established the conceptual model. Then we tested the proposed model on the survey data from G2B service employees using structural equation modeling. The results suggests that customer-oriented training, service skill training and work motivation as input control initiatives significantly impact the service quality. Besides, coproduction with customers and internal supervision as process control initiatives also have a positive effect on service quality. Improved service quality ultimately predicts the performance of G2B service employees.

%X Post-transaction marketing offers are often designed to trick consumers into purchasing products they would not want. To increase the frequncy of transactions, retailers use strategies such as subscribing consumers by default to offers, camouflaging post-transaction offers as part of primary transactions, and being unclear about the terms of the offer. Further, sharing agreements for personal consumer data and payment credentials between first and third-party retailers violate consumers´ expectations about privacy and business conduct. Some of these tactics have been mitigated in the United States with the Restore Online Shoppers´ Confidence Act (ROSCA). In this paper, we report the results from an online post-transaction marketing experiment. We involve over 500 consumers in a purchasing episode (i.e., a functional mock-up music store) followed by a post-transaction marketing offer with low valu to consumers. In the experiment, we systematically vary important design characteristics on the offer page, and collect additional data through a post-experimental qustionnaire. We investigate which factors are most predictive of acceptance of the low-valu post-transaction offer. We find that ROSCA´s interventions are a step in the right direction and should be considered by European regulators, but do not go far enough.

%X Companies increasingly involve consumers in product design and development, e.g. through built-to-order and mass customization or by integrating data generated at the point of sale into product development and production processes. The latter approach requires that companies provide online tools and interfaces like product configurators for consumer participation in value co-creation. Our research addresses the question how to design such tools to i) ob-tain reliable data and ii) keep customers happy with both products and value co-creation processes. In a lab experiment, we show how two interface elements, default values and task difficulty, affect consumers' product satisfaction, and satisfaction with the configuration process. Results indicate that product satis-faction is influenced by default values while process satisfaction is not, and task difficulty influences neither.

%X With the development of 3G and a growing scale of mobile terminal holders, location based service (LBS) has the very broad market prospect. But now whether from the perspective of the cognitive degree or market scale, the application status of location based service are not satisfactory. At present, researches mostly stagnate in technical level, and less on consumers’ behavior. In this paper, we establish the research model of consumers’ intention to use location based service from the angle of perceived risks and apply the empirical test. The results of the study show that perceived service business risks, perceived service product risks and perceived financial risks have significant negative influence on users’ intention to adopt LBS. In addition, whether the users have experience of using the LBS will influence usage intention to some extent. Overall, the results of this study can help mobile agents understand the sources of business risks, so that they can regulate their own behavior, formulate rational policy and eliminate the risks in order to promote the long-term development of LBS.

%X The proliferation of digital technologies enhances the possibilities for collecting customer data. This has tremendously increased the interest in the use of business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) to generate knowledge about customers’ behaviour, preferences and demands. Firms have recognised the potential of BI&A; however, they are still unsure about the exact action possibilities of BI&A to enhance their customer orientation. Thus, in this paper, we aim to identify the functional affordances of BI&A with regard to the establishment of customer-oriented work practices. We conducted an interpretive single case study of a bank in Switzerland. Our results reveal seven affordances from the firm’s perspective. These findings enable us to explain how BI&A may be used in the case-study organisation and what its potential outcomes are. Moreover, we highlight the contributions of BI&A to a firm’s customer response and customer orientation capabilities.

%X Self-service technologies (SSTs) enable individuals to be independent and act at their own pace in their own time in consuming services that would ordinarily require delivery through a human resource. One emerging trend in SSTs is the implementation of such technologies to support individual training and learning, thus adapting to individuals' needs and pace. We leverage the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model to better understand how the characteristics of SSTs may facilitate individual learning transfer and enhance individual performance. We explore this phenomenon by conducting a multilevel field study involving 182 employees and 39 managers in 39 retail stores.

%X The DeLone and McLean (D&M) model (2003) has been broadly used and generally recognised as a useful model for gauging the success of IS implementations. However, it is not without limitations. In this study, we evaluate a model that extends the D&M model and attempts to address some of its limitations by providing a more complete measurement model of systems success. To that end, we augment the D&M (2003) model and include three variables: business value, institutional trust, and future readiness. We propose that the addition of these variables allows systems success to be assessed at both the systems level and the business level. Consequently, we develop a measurement model rather than a structural or predictive model of systems success.
%X As this augmented model is intended to be used in the field, assessing the validity and appropriateness of the augmented measurement model is necessary. Accordingly, we empirically test the augmented model in the context of e-logistics tracking systems. The empirical testing reveals that four distinct dimensions or characteristics are required for a successful e-logistics tracking system implementation. Those four distinct dimensions are divided into systems level (i.e., quality and continued usage support) and business level (i.e., business value and sustainability of competitive position). While this study confirms the importance of system quality as the main dimension, managers should also ensure continued usage support, business value, and sustainability of competitive position are considered when assessing the success of their tracking systems. Consequently, adopting a one-size-fit-all approach to systems is not ideal. By including these three factors, the needs of all levels of management are more fully assessed helping to improve tactical and strategic decision making relative to current and planned tracking systems.

%X Recommender systems are an increasingly important technology and researchers have recently argued for incorporating different kinds of data to improve recommendation quality. This paper presents a novel approach to generating recommendations and evaluates its effectiveness. First, we review evidence that item viewing time can reveal user preferences for items. Second, we model item preference as a weighted function of preferences for item attributes. We then propose a method for generating recommendations based on these two propositions. The results of a laboratory evaluation show that the proposed approach generated estimated item ratings consistent with explicit item ratings and assigned high ratings to products that reflect revealed preferences of users. We conclude by discussing implications and identifying areas for future research.

%X The concerns individuals express over the privacy of their personal information could inhibit them from disclosing their personal information, despite the benefits they may attain from doing so. However, while individuals' express privacy concerns, they still continue to disclose personal information. The actions of such individuals, known as the privacy paradox, suggests that there are factors are present which may influence or  inhibit individuals from disclosing personal information. The aim of our study is to investigate the privacy paradox to better understand individuals' decisions to withhold or disclose personal information. We argue that individuals disclose personal information based on a cognitive disposition, which includes rational and emotional mental processes. We further posit that by adopting techniques, tools and theories from the cognitive neuroscience will help us better understanding the privacy paradox.

%X Firms are increasingly using clickstream and transactional data to tailor product offerings to visitors at their site. Ecommerce websites have the opportunity, at each interaction, to offer multiple items (referred to as an offer set) that might be of interest to a visitor. We consider a scenario where a firm is interested in maximizing the expected payoff when composing an offer set. We develop a methodology that considers possible future offer sets based on the current choices of the user and identifies an offer set that will maximize expected payoffs for an entire session. Our framework considers both the items viewed and purchased by a visitor and models the probability of an item being viewed and purchased separately when calculating expected payoffs. The possibility of a user backtracking and viewing a previously offered item is also explicitly modelled. We show that identifying the optimal offer set is a difficult problem when the number of candidate items is large and the offer set consists of several items even for short time horizons. We develop an efficient heuristic for the one period look-ahead case and show that even by considering such a short horizon the approach is much superior to alternative benchmark approaches. Proposed methodology demonstrates how the appropriate use of information technologies can help e-commerce sites improve their profitability.

%X Internet celebrities are widely observable on social media platforms and are an essential component to a social media marketing program. Drawing on the media success literature and online influencer research, this study reflects Internet celebrities’ fame-seeking practices and discusses on three issues from literature: definition of Internet celebrities, Internet celebrities’ identification criteria and what factors can contribute to individual online influence. A series of interview from three Internet celebrities and three followers of each celebrity were conducted to enrich this study. The results show that Internet celebrities are people who have become famous by means of Internet, and have the ability to influence others. They are characterized as having a certain number of followers; high level of interactivity on their profile; and promising business value. Moreover, this study suggests a five-dimensional perspective to understand individual online influence. We believe that these findings provide new insights for interpretation of Internet celebrities and suggest a possible success formula for fame-seekers to achieve influence on the increasingly competitive social media platforms.

%X The pervasiveness of information-based organizations, combined with the escalating number of security breaches, has resulted in the need for better information security. Nevertheless, obtaining subjects for information security research is challenging. Structured interviews were conducted with thirteen information security managers in the finance, healthcare, and insurance industries to investigate the effect of the perceived strategic value of participating in information security research on the decision to participate in such research. Subramanian and Nosek’s (2001) perception of strategic value of information systems (PSVIS) framework was used to guide the interviews. The results showed that the perceived strategic value of participating in information security research influenced the decision to participate. A model of the strategic value of participating in information security research is provided. It suggests that access to information for strategic decision making directly influences the decision to participate and two other factors (information intensity and strategic necessity) moderates that relationship.

%X With the recent rapid growth of fake mobile phones in China’s mobile market, the objective of this study is to address this important issue by exploring the specific antecedents of consumers’ perception of value, as drawn from value-based theory. Perceived risks, which are modelled by four risk dimensions (physical, performance, social, and warranty), and value for money, are highlighted as the two key precursors of the perceived value and, further, relationships among these dimensions are examined by Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis. The results of this empirical research, as expected, support the dimension of perceived risk consisting of the four types of perceived risk, and the impact on perceived value and value for money. Furthermore, the influence of value perceived as value for money is also confirmed to have a positive correlation.

%X Building on multiple theoretical perspectives, we examined how e-business capability moderates the association of different dimensions of market orientation (i.e., customer, competitor, and inter-functional coordination orientation) and firm performance (i.e., financial, operational, and customer service performance). We tested hypotheses using survey data from senior executives in China. Our findings reveal that both customer orientation and inter-functional coordination can positively impact firm performance, while competitor orientation cannot affect firm performance significantly. Further, we found the complicated and interesting moderating effects of e-business capability on the multiple relationships between market orientation and firm performance. Specifically, e-business capability can strengthen the impact of customer orientation on financial and operational performance, but it weakens the relationship between competitor orientation and financial performance and the relationship between inter-functional coordination and customer service. Theoretical contributions and managerial implications of the study are discussed.

%X Peer-to-peer platforms in the realm of the sharing economy, such as Airbnb or BlaBlaCar, have heavily rattled the electronic commerce landscape and are expected to further impact consumer behavior in the future. While trust between the parties involved is of utmost importance in such platform economies, experimental research on this aspect is scarce. In this conceptual paper, we first present an experimental framework for targeting trust in the sharing economy based on experimental economics and the trust game in particular. In doing so, we sketch out a path to complement existing Information Systems research on the sharing economy by experimental methods. Second, we apply the framework to a specific use case, by developing a research model and experimental design to explore the role of user representation for trust on sharing economy platforms. We therefore set the stage for controlled (laboratory) experiments to enrich research on trust in the sharing economy.

%X In order to explore how Web search volume dynamically influences product sales during the whole product life cycle, this paper collects Web search volume and sales data of movies and does an empirical analysis using econometric models. The empirical results show that Web search volume before the launch of a new product has a positive impact on the product sales in the initial period of introduction stage. During the whole product life cycle, Web search volume has a positive and significant impact on product sales, but the impact declines gradually across the life cycle. The impact of Web search volume on sales is larger in the early stage of the product life cycle than in the late stage of the product life cycle.

%X The rapid and increasingly universal acceptance of online transactions has resulted in governments providing an increasingly wide range of online services to the general public. The successful experience of launching e-government portals and services, including transactional ones, in the industrialised countries has led to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to adopt similar such models for a wide array of public service entities. Although there is now a considerable literature on the various aspects of the efficiency, effectiveness and customer satisfaction with regard to e-government services, the majority of the associated analytical frameworks and models were not designed within the sociocultural context of the Arabian Gulf and its business environment. The purpose of this study is therefore to identify and present a framework on the quality determinants of the e-services which are currently provided by the UAE’s Ministry of Interior (MOI) to the public. As these services are already in place, it will focus in particular on a theoretical model and the mechanisms by which these services can be adapted and enhanced.

%X Social network platforms have been so popularized that they are to be indispensable to daily life. In recent years, the electronic commerce marketplace faces the problems: like searching for product providers and trust issues of product providers. People are used to deal with the guy they are familiar with and more believe their friends’ words than unknown comments. In this paper, we develop an appraisal mechanism for social marketplace to search the product requests from buyer’s social network and verify product providers based on the experience of friends within a buyer’s social network. The proposed framework provides a social search mechanism to explore the product providers and estimates trustworthiness values of product providers from the view of social network for helping buyers solve the inaccuracy and inconvenience issues in social marketplace.

As mobile computing becomes more and more common, difference in navigation and the ability to foster focus may lead to changes in the way in which consumers read and react to mobile product reviews compared to online reviews. We use research related to mobile computing limitations, Mobile Self Efficacy and information overload to outlines a study in which two common online review outcomes, trust in the review and purchase intention are evaluated in a mobile environment.

%X Uncertainty has been regarded as the most prominent barrier in ecommerce. However, how communication between buyers and seller contributes to a reduction in uncertainty is under-investigated. Integrating uncertainty reduction theory and relational contract theory, we develop a model that explain how various communication strategies will reduce uncertainty in transactions so as to encourage purchase behavior. In addition, we also explore the role of swift relationships and institutional structures during the uncertainty reduction process, surveying real buyers as data subjects. The study advances our understanding of communication strategies by specifying the e-commerce context to explore how communication can facilitate purchase behavior through uncertainty reduction. We propose that the communication process between individual buyers and sellers may be moderated by both formal and relational contracts. Also, we add to the existing literature by investigating whether formal contracts will affect a relational contract’s impact in the online shopping context.

%X As the number of SNSs increases, it is challenging for SNS providers to obtain and retain user loyalty toward a SNS site. By integrating both network externalities theory and VTSL (Value-Trust-Satisfaction-Loyalty) model, we propose a research model to investigate how perceived value derived from network externalities affects trust in SNS site and user satisfaction, which further lead to user loyalty. Data analysis was conducted using a total of 267 responses. The results show that perceived network size and perceived complementarity exert significant effect on functional, emotional, and social value. It is also shown that functional and social value influence positively on trust in SNS site, but emotional value is not related to trust. Functional and emotional value are found to be significant determinants of user satisfaction, however social value is not related to user satisfaction. User satisfaction is found to be a strong determinant of user loyalty. Given the findings, SNS providers need to increase network size and accommodate complementary services, applications, and supporting tools to obtain and retain user loyalty.

%X Digital devices already outnumber the people on Earth. This multi-device environment is bound to have implications on the way technology is used. However, little research has investigated this emerging phenomenon. This research-in-progress paper presents our initial analysis of multi-digital device usage. We use electronic experience sampling method to gather data on users’ daily in situ experiences of using multiple devices on tasks both at work and at home. We then use a sociomateriality lens to help us analyse this data. Preliminary findings point to three interesting insights - (1) Users select devices by evaluating their relative (rather than absolute) affordances, (2) Users select devices based on perceived positive synergies across devices, and (3) Users working on more than 3 tasks were found to be filling dead time

%X The developing world’s electronic commerce potential is huge. However, it has been demonstrated that successful e-business models from developed countries do not seem to transfer well to developing countries. We argue one reason for this is that perceptions of trust differ across developing and developed nations. This, in turn, requires a different design for e-commerce markets. This paper focuses on the impact of trust perception on infrastructure in Chinese e-commerce. A price comparison of Taobao (an institutional trust-based electronic market) and WeChat (an interpersonal trust-based electronic market) for 34 products purchased from outside China demonstrates that sellers in interpersonal trust-based electronic markets can command a higher price than those in institutional trust-based ones. Furthermore, trust labels (a standard form of institutional trust in western emarkets) appear to command no benefit in China. Our research suggests e-commerce companies planning on moving to China should focus on incorporating technologies facilitating interpersonal trust rather than institutional trust.

%X With the increased popularity of online social networks, friends become an available recommendation source for decisions that are made on the Internet, such as online purchases. There is substantial benefit in integrating different recommendation sources into one recommendation system so that more information and indeed more relevant information can be provided to the user. However, there is also the burden on the user of having to cope with the broader scope of and sometimes differing advice provided. This paper focuses on the issue of potential cognitive dissonance between the user?s own preferences, social influencer?s (e.g., friend?s) recommendations, and advice from a recommendation agent (RA). It provides a model of how different recommendation system designs can lead to different magnitudes of dissonance and when. It also discusses the role of the user?s product knowledge on influencing the extent of and reaction with dissonance. This paper contributes to the designing of recommendation systems which can create synergies between different recommendation sources to best assist the user.

We apply signaling theory to elaborate the role of image-based and text-based information in consumersâ€™ purchase decisions and use deep neural networks model to analyze different types of information in online sales websites. We collect information about 4,368 furniture products from Amazon and find that both image-based and text-based information influence consumersâ€™ purchase decisions, but the former one is more crucial. This paper makes contributions to e-commerce literature by elaborating the signaling role of available information in sales websites, highlighting the importance of considering both text-based and image-based information in the data analysis, and demonstrating how to apply advanced deep learning techniques and models in e-commerce studies.

%X Commercial sharing program, as a form of sharing economy providing access-based service to consumers is becoming increasing popular. Customer cooperation largely influences its success and business performance. Taking the value co-creation perspective grounded in service-dominant (S-D) logic, this study explores user in-role participation and extra-role participation and their antecedents in the context of the commercial bike sharing service. Empirical research findings indicate that altruism, reward, and user knowledge enhance user in-role and extra-role participation, whereas perceived ease of use promotes user in-role participation, and user satisfaction and commitment increase user extra-role participation. Implications from the study findings and future research directions are also discussed.

%X A company can experience various benefits and effects on business performance from advertising on a social networking site, including an increase in its number of fans and advertisement views and/or an increase in sales and return on investment (ROI). While some companies find Facebook an effective platform for social networking advertisements, others deem it ineffective. These mixed results of the impact of social networking services on business performance, in addition to the fact that many companies are expected to be influenced by social media in this social economy due to its growth and popularity among consumers, have motivated this research in progress. This study aims to address and understand the reasons for such differing results on business performance and identify the factors affecting the outcomes of organizations’ social media projects. A multiple case study is adopted to meet these aims. First, a thorough review of literature and content analysis of several prior and publicly available case studies on firms that were either successful or unsuccessful with social media advertising are conducted. These steps are done to identify the underlying factors that contribute to the impact of social media on business performance. Next, the multiple case study method is adopted to identify and explain the behaviors of the contextual factors that cause differing impacts of social media on business performance. To understand the varying effects of social media on business performance, institutional theory, transaction costs theory and symbolic interactionism are applied in this study. The expected outcomes from this study include: (1) proposing a conceptual model of factors affecting the performance of businesses utilizing social media, and (2) producing a better understanding of the issues and factors impacting the performance of businesses utilizing social media.

%X Navigation structure and user familiarity are critical for user satisfaction, yet the mediating mechanisms by which they affect satisfaction remain unclear, especially from a cognitive perspective. To extend understanding of the drivers of user satisfaction with a website, this study focuses on the mediating roles of cognitive load and performance outcomes (in the form of efficiency and accuracy) according to a cognitive cost–benefit framework and cognitive load theory. The hypotheses were tested with data from a field quasi-experiment among 238 participants using two websites. The results indicated that cognitive load and performance outcomes fully mediated the effect of user familiarity on user satisfaction, and that cognitive load partially mediated the impact of navigation structure. In addition, the mediating effect of cognitive load appeared stronger than that of performance outcomes. Overall, the cognitive cost–benefit framework sheds light on the underlying influence processes and mechanisms by which navigation structure and user familiarity affect user satisfaction. The findings reveal that costs might have more profound influences on user satisfaction in an information-seeking context than benefits do.

%X Social networking websites have not only become the most prevalent communication tools in today’s digital age but also one of the top big data sources. Big data advocates promote the promising benefits of big data applications to both users and practitioners. However, public polls show evidence of heightened privacy concerns among Internet and social media users. We review the privacy literature based on protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior to develop an APCO model that incorporates novel factors that reflect users’ familiarity with big data. Our results, which we obtained from using a cross-sectional survey design and structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, support most of our proposed hypotheses. Specifically, we found that that awareness of big data had a negative impact on and awareness of big data implications had a positive impact on privacy concerns. In turn, privacy concerns impacted self-disclosure concerns positively and self-disclosure accuracy negatively. We also considered other antecedents of privacy concerns and tested other alternative models to examine the mediating role of privacy concerns, to control for demographic variables, and to investigate different roles of the trust construct. Finally, we discuss the results of our findings and the theoretical and practical implications.

Managing big data is not a simple technical issue, but a complex managerial and strategic one. To achieve the vast potential of big data not only will enterprise IT architectures need to change, firms also need a new strategy, a new mind set, and a capability to deal with unexpected environmental turbulence. In this paper, we present a conceptual model and a novel analysis method, fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to model interdependent non-linear relationships among elements and outcomes. We posit that data management strategy, big data competences, IT capability and organization improvisational capability are interdependent and mutual reinforcing that form a network of nonlinear influential factors for firm decision quality and in turn, performance.

%X Social media is the gathering place of a large pool of consumers. It is the repository of consumer information and acts as a means of spreading information to build market presence. Most literature states that organizational usage of social media enhances customer relations, but social media also acts as a medium for information acquisition. Not many previous studies have investigated the role of social media on information accessibility. Therefore this study examined the impact of social media on information accessibility. A total of 171 organization responded to the survey and the result of the survey showed that social media usage has a positive impact on information accessibility. Also it was found that factors such as interactivity, trust and institutional pressure positively influence social media usage in organizations. This study provided a clearer understanding on the real importance of social media and its benefits towards information acquisition. The results would motivate and guide organizations in social media usage for information acquisition which is important for understanding the customers, competitors and the industry and to develop strategies for enhancing business performance.

%X Multisensory marketing has been seen as an approach improving advertising effect in the social science, neuroscience, and marketing literature. For examining visual/audio synesthesia, the effect of smelling and tasting an online product, this study first developed design elements of digital video advertising: rational/emotional appeals and fast/slow tempo. Moreover, it strives to investigate empirically the effects of various online advertisement contexts on consumer emotion, attitude, and behavioral intention. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) in a scenario-based laboratory experiments. Data collected from 166 customers provide strong support for the research model. Through EEG and SEM analyses, in rational advertisings, consumers’ olfactory was triggered and both arousal and pleasure of the emotions affected the attitudes; in emotional advertisings, not only olfactory but gustatory were triggered and only pleasure affected the attitudes. By understanding online advertising design and synesthesia, insights from the findings can benefit designers and marketers in implementing more effective marketing strategies.

%X The impact of electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on consumer purchase decisions in social networking sites (SNSs) has been an very important topic to researchers and practitioners. Friends on the SNSs, via Web connections, conversation, and collaboration, create product recommendations and eWOM. Previously, when consumers needed information, they usually through marketing channels such as TV advertising or network advertising to get product-related information; however, there are more consumers through their friends on the SNSs to get these useful eWOM now. This paper focuses on social relationships (social ties, trust, and identification), social exchange (reciprocity and enjoyment helping), and motivation and ability to access information (motivation to access information and ability to access information) in the SNSs to explore its impact on cognition and affective attitudes, and then have the eWOM effect. The research method is survey, and the research subject is the users on SNSs. We take online questionnaire to investigate these users’ eWOM intention and their opinions. The survey results from 212 participants on the SNS suggest that trust and motivation to access information are positively associated with users’ cognition and affective attitudes, whereas ability to access information only affects the cognition attitudes. In addition, users’ cognitive attitude positively influences users’ affective attitude and eWOM intention. Taken together, the paper provides insight into theses factors that shape eWOM and outlines additional questions that deserve further study.

%X Recommender systems have been widely utilized by online merchants and online advertisers to promote their products in order to improve profits. By evaluating customer interests based on their purchase history and relating it to commodities for sale these retailers could excavate out products which are most likely to be chosen by a specific customer. In this case, online ratings given by customers are of great interest as they could reflect different levels of customers’ interest on different products. Collaborative Filtering (CF) approach is chosen by a large amount of web-based retailers for their recommender systems because CF operates on interactions between customers and products. In this paper, a major approach of CF, Matrix Factorization, is modified to give more accurate recommendations by predicting online ratings.

Unlike material agents, algorithmic agents can act in the absence of proximal instigation by human agents, and can influence the actions of other agents distanced in space and time. By borrowing from actor-network theory, this paper foregrounds the role of algorithmic agents in the actualization of complex affordances by advertisers on a social media platform. It is illustrated that a complex affordance is actualized through an agencement, that is, a collective enactment of heterogeneous agencies. Through such an enactment, human agents are able to act at a distance too. This research highlights that in addition to material features of the user-interface, the underlying algorithms of a complex technology also partake in the actualization of affordances.

%X Online health consultation communities (OHCCs) provide a digital channel for physicians to signal their professional competence (i.e., credibility) and compassionate care (i.e., benevolence), and for patients to spread word-of-mouth reviews. The valence, volume, and variance of patient reviews may shape the effectiveness of signals transmitted by physicians in OHCCs. We investigate the interactions between the signaling mechanism and the online feedback mechanism through which OHCCs help physicians build online popularity and achieve price premiums for online health consultations. We are using web scraping to collect weekly data for 12 months from a large OHCC in China. Applying mixed effects models on the data collected to date, we find online popularity and price premiums to be two benefits that physicians can derive from OHCCs. Importantly, in the presence of benevolence actions, an absence of consistently favorable online feedback slows down physicians’ online popularity and reduces price premiums for online health consultations.

%X Research on Information Systems (IS) habit formation has been focused mostly on IS habit’s effect on IS continuance. Antecedents of IS habit formation, as reported in the literature,  are  primarily on users’  prior behavior and comprehensiveness of usage.  Most of the literature focus on  analyzing  the relationship between users’ IS usage behavior and IS habit.  Limited work has been reported to investigate  genuine and practical ways to develop IS habit, as well as to address  the issue of sporadic IS usage,  which leads to  different interpretations  on  IS  habit and continuance. This study purports to address the theoretical gap on issues related to IS habit antecedents and sporadic IS  usage  habit in the educational context. Adopting an empirical survey in universities’  (sub-degree  and postgraduate settings) learning systems usage, data from cross-sectional survey on learning systems usage on per-course basis is analyzed. Theoretically, our results suggest that IT functionality design (personalization) and social factor (peer effect) have strong and positive relationship on IS habit  with respect to the sporadic usage nature of course based learning systems. Practically, we suggest some dimensions for teachers on curriculum design that facilitate IS habit development, e.g., maintaining an online community with substantial student peer input at the early stage of a course.

%X This paper is written with two main aims: firstly, to justify the use of grounded theory (GT) as a data analysis method in a manner compatible with the case study strategy, by using Straussian GT in this integration. The need for this integration is vital, as no conceptual research specifies how grounded theory can be used as a method within an interpretive case study strategy in order to define a research methodology. The second aim is demonstrating the applicability of the proposed methodology, which has resulted from the integration, by providing a typical example of applying the methodology’s steps to the empirical research conducted in the area of the security perception of e-commerce.

%X The idea of interacting with computers through natural language dates back to the 1960s, but recent technological advances have led to a renewed interest in conversational agents such as chatbots or digital assistants. In the customer service context, conversational agents promise to create a fast, convenient, and cost-effective channel for communicating with customers. Although numerous agents have been implemented in the past, most of them could not meet the expectations and disappeared. In this paper, we present our design science research project on how to design cooperative and social conversational agents to increase service quality in customer service. We discuss several issues that hinder the success of current conversational agents in customer service. Drawing on the cooperative principle of conversation and social response theory, we propose preliminary meta-requirements and design principles for cooperative and social conversational agents. Next, we will develop a prototype based on these design principles.

%X Despite the recognition of the significance of the crafts industry for inclusive development, its informal, disaggregated and disenfranchised nature poses several problems for the rural artisans, who are often forced to live in poverty. Extant approaches to address the industry’s problems have involved siloed attempts, wherein interventions were appropriated to resolve issues within parts of the supply chain, resulting in persistence of the issues. Using Self-Help- Group women in rural India as a case in point, the paper adopts a discovery orientation and action research alignment to evolve the design principles of an ICT driven peer-to-peer collaborative, decentralized supply chain model known as Nex-Gen Cottage Industry as a means to organise the industry. The results of a pre-pilot study in a village Kandi have been discussed along with the implications of this research for academia and the society.

%X With the increasing prosperity of online marketplaces, millions of items are available on a single plat-form. Due to the limited cognitive capacity of human beings, consumers make purchase decisions in a way that balances both effort and accuracy, as contended by the effort-accuracy trade-off (EATO) framework. However, we propose that the rich functionality of online decision support aids (DSAs), namely image-based searching, cross-platform comparison and collocation recommendation, can first simplify consumers’ information processing in terms of problem identification, alternative generation and product evaluation. DSAs can then help consumers achieve a high level of accuracy in the deci-sion elicitation and making process with minimal effort. We refer to this as effort-accuracy co-existence (EACE) that highlights the non-inversed relationship between effort and accuracy as well as the extended cognitive boundary in consumers’ purchase decision making. We plan to validate the conceptual model using experiments with online buyers. The proposed methodology and implications are discussed in this research-in-progress paper.

%X Development of information communication technologies brings increasingly more opportunities for optimising various processes and activities of organisations. In the case of platforms, such as Facebook and Google, it is especially relevant to small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs can adopt ready-to-use information communication technology solutions provided by those platforms for different aspects of their business. The paper aims to find out how SMEs use possibilities of such platforms to innovate business models. Two cases of Lithuanian SMEs are analysed to check the theoretical assumptions summarised in the paper. The case analysis indicates, that use of the platforms contributes to reaching (new) target customers, making adjustments to value propositions, maintaining customer relationships, channels, and thus becoming key resources and supporting key activities, therefore become key partners.

%X Web-based live-chat support services are one promising means toward improving customer service. However, such services and their success factors have been rarely studied. This study bridges this gap. It builds on justice and service marketing theories, and examines key factors that drive intentions to continue using web-based live-chat support services and to provide positive word-of-mouth. The study suggests that these outcomes are increased through interactional justice perceptions, which are diminished by the perceived busyness of the service provider. It is also suggested that the latter effect is moderated by the duration of live-chat session; when the session is long the effect is stronger. Data collected from 86 users of a library web-based live-chat service were analyzed with SEM techniques and support this view. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

%X The rapid spread of social media has brought new ways for marketers to communicate and manage brands online. Celebrity endorsement has been a popular practice in social media, however, what contributes to its effectiveness has not been fully understood. To address this issue, this study examines the effects of endorsement in social media towards brand attitude and merchandise attractiveness based on the source credibility model. We propose source credibility elements: attractiveness, expertise, and trustworthiness, to be positively related to consumer attitude. We test these hypotheses by conducting online survey with 183 participants in Indonesia. This study demonstrated that brand attitude was influenced by endorser’s attractiveness and trustworthiness, meanwhile merchandise attractiveness was influenced by endorser’s expertise and trustworthiness.

%X Digital payments evolve as the next generation system to take over the global commerce landscape in the same manner in which internet and mobile telephony had dominated the traditional communication domains. The use of mobile banking apps has spurred the digital medium across the globe and resulted in a fundamental shift in retailing practices. The purpose of this paper is to comprehend various factors influencing the customer’s continuance intention-behavior to use mobile banking apps. In this study, we developed a research model that encompasses the attributes of Expectation confirmation theory (ECT) and Self-determination theory (SDT). The research model was tested using survey data collected from 744 respondents across various demographics and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand the usage behavior of mobile banking apps in a multi-faceted business environment. The various hypothesis of the research model indicate that mobile banking apps continuance intention usage behavior is strongly influenced by the satisfaction, intrinsic and identified regulations, whereas satisfaction is influenced by the expectation-confirmation, trust, and quality. The research findings reveal that, “An enormous potential are available for marketing managers and researchers to tape these opportunities and plan for continual and sustainable growth of mobile banking apps. “

%X Previous research shows that consumers use online reviews for a variety of reasons. For many products / services, there are a large number of reviews which makes it difficult for consumers to decide which reviews to pay attention to. Hence, previous research has suggested that online reviews websites can provide a customized review sorting system for each individual consumer. Consequently, drawing upon five consumer segments as well as 10 restaurant characteristics found in the literature, we propose a content-filtering recommender system that evaluates individual online reviews and assigns a numeric score to each review for each of the five consumer segments. The numeric scores can later be used to sort online reviews for individual consumers according to their taste for restaurants.

%X The ubiquitous usage of Social Media Networks makes them an increasingly important tool for businesses operating solely or partly online. They can support traffic generation, especially when guiding members from their Social Networking Service (SNS) towards the e-business website. In this work, we explore the question about how sharing motivation models need to be designed to provide an efficient sharing trigger for the e-customer considering its age and gender. Based on data collected online in two countries with a developed digital culture (N=409 as a whole sample and n= 134 for online sharing customers), we examine self-reported and experimental scenario-based motivations for sharing e-business content. Our findings indicate that while gender of the e-customer is irrelevant for the sharing behaviour, the customer age plays an important role and needs to be considered when designing a sharing model based on sharing buttons for SNS.

%X This study examines the impact of loss leader strategy on the sales of core products in an online marketplace. We assess differential effects of loss leading products according to their associations with core products, and further examine moderating roles of peer reviews and product prices that serve as informational cues in online marketplaces. We collect a unique dataset containing information about individual-level transactions and product-specific characteristics. To deal with endogeneity issues in adopting the loss leader strategy for particular sub-markets, we conduct a difference-in-differences analysis in combination with propensity score matching at the sub-market level. Our results suggest that the introduction of loss leading product would be positively associated with the sales of core products only when they have non-substitutional relationships with the core products. Further, this study examines that such association can be strengthened/weakened by the informational cues. Interpretations and implications of the results are presented.

%X From an economic perspective, dynamic pricing seems to be the profit maximizing pricing strategy for consumer-to-consumer (C2C) sharing platforms because it allows balancing supply and demand over time. Based on distributive justice and equity theory we investigate how two characteristics of dynamic pricing, namely -˜fee changes over time’ and -˜fee differences across consumer groups’, influence fairness perception and intention to share of consumers. Using a laboratory experiment, we find that fee differences between lenders and borrowers is the dominant source of negative fairness perception, which in turn results in a lower intention to share, especially for the consumer group that is charged with a higher fee. Consequently, C2C sharing platforms have to be aware of this negative effect from fairness perception when they implement a dynamic two-sided platform pricing strategy to maximize profits.

%X Lie-Nielsen Toolworks (LNT) is a small, family-owned company manufacturing very high-quality woodworking tools in coastal Maine. They face three major challenges: the sparse rural labor market makes it difficult to find and retain talent; their extreme quality standards lead to waste and rework; they struggle to forecast demand and schedule production due in part to offering a large number of SKUs in small quantities. Having reorganized the factory layout and upgraded its CNC machines over the past two years, LNT is now turning to information systems and analytics as tools for improvement. Advised by an internal IT staff of one, an external ERP partner, and an analytics consultant, Tom Lie-Nielsen must decide how to approach these information technologies, what benefits he can expect, and what organizational changes might be necessary to effectively leverage them.

I also present and discuss Sprague’s DSS development framework with its dialog, data, and models (DDM) paradigm and characteristics. At its core, the development framework remains valid in today’s world of business intelligence and big data analytics. I present and discuss a contemporary reference architecture for business intelligence and analytics (BI/A) in the context of Sprague’s DSS development framework. The practice of decision support continues to evolve and can be described by a maturity model with DSS, enterprise data warehousing, real-time data warehousing, big data analytics, and the emerging cognitive as successive generations. I use a DSS perspective to describe and provide examples of what the forthcoming cognitive generation will bring.

%X Mobile applications (also known as “apps”) have rapidly grown into a multibillion-dollar industry. Because they are available through devices that are “always on” and often with the user, users often adopt mobile apps “on the fly” as they need them. As a result, users often base their adoption and disclosure decisions only on the information provided through the mobile app delivery platform (e.g., the Apple App Store™ or Google Play™). The fact that using a mobile app often requires one to disclose an unprecedented combination of personal information (e.g., location data, preferences, contacts, calendars, browsing history, music library) means that one makes a complex risk/benefit tradeoff decision based on only the small amount of information that the mobile app delivery platform provides—and all in a short period of time. Hence, this process is much shorter and much riskier than traditional software adoption. Through two experiments involving 1,588 mobile app users, we manipulated three primary sources of information provided by a platform (app quality ratings, network size, and privacy assurances) to understand their effect on perceptions of privacy risks and benefits and, in turn, how they influence consumer adoption intentions and willingness to pay (WTP). We found that network size influenced not only perceived benefits but also the perceived risks of apps in the absence of perfect information. In addition, we found that integrating a third party privacy assurance system into the app platform had a significant influence on app adoption and information disclosure. We also found that a larger network size reduces LBS privacy risk perceptions, which confirms our information cascade hypothesis. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.

These technologies require people (nicknamed “data scientists”) from many business disciplines who are capable of managing and analyzing this data for use in decision making processes. In order to educate and train more of these people, there has been an increase in the teaching of analytical tools in both Management Information Systems (MIS) and Business Analytics (BA) programs. This article will describe details of an exercise on business analytics specially tailored for the Introduction to MIS or BA course. The main goal for this project is to educate first year business students about the importance and usefulness of data analytics without discouraging them with excessive coverage of technical software details.

%X Human cognition and decision-making related to information systems (IS) is a major area of interest in IS research. However, despite being explored since the mid-seventies in psychology, the phenomenon of cognitive bias has only recently gained attention among IS researchers. This fact is reflected in a comparatively sparse set of mostly disconnected publications, sometimes using inconsistent theory, methodology, and terminology. We address these issus in our scientometric analysis by providing the first review of cognitive bias-related research in IS. Our systematic literature review of 12 top IS outlets covering the past 20 years identifies 84 publications related to cognitive bias. A subsequnt content analysis shows a strong increase of interest in cognitive bias research in the IS discipline in the observed timeframe, yet uncovers a highly unequal distribution across IS fields and industry contexts. While previous research on perception and decision biases has already led to valuable contributions in IS, there is still considerable potential for further research regarding social, memory and interest biases. Our study reveals research gaps in bias-related IS research and highlights common practices in how biases are identified and measured. We conclude with promising future research avenus with the intent to encourage cumulative knowledge-building.

Customer agility is a vital dynamic capability, which helps managers identify untapped customer demand and reconfigure existing firm assets and capabilities. The purpose of this research-in-progress paper is to set the stage for an empirical study, which aims to explore how internet-enabled technologies influence the development of customer agility. From a theoretical standpoint, this study proposes to draw on two streams of literature: (a) concepts associated with the notion of dynamic capabilities and (b) the literature on cognitive biases and frame reorganization. Broadly, the study intends to contribute to the existing IS research by bridging the strategic and cognitive dimensions of developing internet-enabled customer agility.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of information overload on subjective states towards purchase decision. Based on the framework of stressor-strain-outcome, we regard  information  overload  as  the  antecedent  of  website  fatigue  and  website  anxiety,  which  could  further  influence subjective  states  towards  purchase  decision.  Besides,  customer  involvement  should  be  considered.  The  results  show  that information  overload  leads  to  the  low  level  of  subjective  states  towards  purchase  decision  through  website  fatigue  and website anxiety and customer involvement plays as a moderator. Implications and limitations are also raised.

Data was collected from 307 customers in DiDi-which is one of the largest sharing platforms for travelling in China, and structural equation modeling statistical method was used to test the research model. The empirical results suggest that feedback mechanism and surge pricing are the most significant antecedents in building customers’ trust, followed by payment security, driver certification and social influence. Further, customers’ trust in the car-sharing platform is positively associated with their continuance intention. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the final section.

%X In this study, we develop a conceptual model to illuminate how firms can better compete through service basing on a process view. In accordance with the thought of organizational ambidexterity, we firstly suggest that the efficiency and flexibility in the operation of service process are equally important for organizations desiring to achieve a superior service performance. Additionally, considering that the ambidextrous behavior of organization members is an effective mechanism to attain ambidexterity, we identify two kinds of service behaviors as the crux to promote the ambidextrous state of service processes, concerning IT usage of service personnel and learning behavior of service leaders respectively.

%X In making decisions regarding transacting with web-based vendors, consumers typically consider the uncertainty about vendor behavior or the perceived risk of having personal information misused by vendors. To mitigate these concerns vendors convey cues to improve consumer trust at a very early stage. Initial trust plays a central role in helping consumers overcome perceptions of risk and insecurity and makes them feel comfortable about interacting and transacting with an e-vendor. Therefore, initial trust is critical to both researchers and practitioners. The present paper describes a research-in-progress study that concentrates on webpage visual complexity and order as central factors in the design of web pages to enhance consumers’ initial trust in an online e-vendor.

%X The real estate price is of paramount importance in both economic and social fields. It is a key indicator of the operation of real estate market and its prediction is essential in the decision-making process of both average people and official governments. Past researchers on this topic have already proposed several prediction methods including linear regression models, nonlinear regression models and machine learning models. Nevertheless, those models have generally neglected the impact of human behavior, which we believe is a significant factor of the real estate price prediction. What’s more, past studies have shown that news sentiments could improve the prediction performance of real estate price. Search engine query data were studied to reflect web users’ behavior by analyzing the frequency of words searched by online users. Researchers have already used the news sentiments and query data for prediction, respectively. But none have combined them together as an integrated model. In this paper, we propose an integrated method that throws new light on the prediction of real estate price in China by integrating these two factors into the forecasting model. In our method, we extract sentiment series from both news data and search engine query data by adding weights to original sentiment series that are produced by news data alone. Then both the weighted series and original ones are used as inputs of several well-acknowledged data mining models, including SVR, RBFNN and BPNN, to produce prediction results.
%X To validate the integrated model, we apply it to four representative cities in China respectively, and compare the results produced by the integrated model using weighted inputs with non-integrated ones using original inputs. The results show that for every one of the four cities, the integrated model generally leads to lower prediction errors than the non-integrated ones. This not only validates the model’s accuracy and universality, but also proves the hypothesis that human searching behavior as a strong impact in typical Chinese cities’ real estate market and can enhance the prediction accuracy of real estate prices.

%X Success in online services cannot promise the success in corresponding mobile services. To understand the mobile service adoption behavior under the context of online service transition, this study, taking mobile payment as an example, from a trust transfer perspective, examines users’ acceptance of mobile payment using the TAM (Technology acceptance model). A field survey with 220 mobile payment student users is conducted to test the research model and hypotheses. The key findings include: trust of online payment and structural assurance play the crucial role in the initial trust of mobile payments; perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness positively influent trust in mobile payment. Limitations, theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

However, it still remains unknown how such new communication ways between buyers and sellers influence individual online shopping intention. How the limited attention resource would be assigned to the main information of endogenous and exogenous cues in the video, and then lead to shopping intention become interesting and important research questions. This study examines these questions from the view of gender difference and social influence with eye-tracking tool. An experiment is designed to capture the visual pattern of selective attention to endogenous and exogenous cues when participants watching Taobao live-show video. Data from Eye-tracking index and questionnaire will be collected to validate the proposed model. Potential contributions and implications for future research are discussed.

%X Modern technologies, including mobile applications and Internet-based platforms, continuously foster the rise of the sharing economy. In this paper, we focus on Uber, a ridesharing platform that is one of the fastest growing startups worldwide. We take the perspective of a potential customer and investigate the implications of trust. In particular, we modify a research model by Gefen (2000) and investigate the influence of trust on the customers’ intentions: ‘Inquire about drivers’ and ‘Request a ride’. In this regard, we differentiate between ‘Trust in Uber’ and ‘Trust in drivers’, while incorporating the two antecedents: ‘Disposition to trust’ and ‘Familiarity with Uber’. The study employs survey data (n = 221) and structural equation modeling (CB SEM). Our results provide empirical evidence that ‘Trust in Uber’ influences the customers’ intentions, whereas the influence of ‘Trust in drivers’ is insignificant.

%X Smart home (SH) products and services aim to enhance the comfort, convenience, security, entertainment, health, education and communication of tenants and their guests enabled by information technology platforms. Despite ongoing waves of enthusiasm, the SH market has remained a niche for more than three decades. At the same time, recent forecast expect the market to grow at high rates in the upcoming years as various global players, like Google, Apple, AT&T, Cisco and Samsung, are lining up with own SH platform initiatives. Accounting for the multi-sidedness of the market, we employ a platform ecosystem perspective to investigate the role of complementary assets for SH adoption by consumers and firms. Based on interviews with 25 experts from 22 companies, our qualitative content analysis reveals and prioritizes complementary goods, sales channels, brand image, expertise, support infrastructure, operational footprint and financial resources as critical complementary assets. Further, we provide managerial implications for platform sponsors regarding the affiliation with complementary suppliers, the legitimacy of sponsorship, platform openness as well as on platform envelopment.

%X Online Government products and services should provide benefits to all citizens, but not all of them are attaining the gains. A group that is not obtaining the benefits is the older adults. Such differences have led to a phenomenon known as the digital divide, which is a research gap that researchers are attempting to eliminate. Using this as motivation, this study aims to identify, explain and understand the adoption and use of e-Government services within the older adults of a vicinity in Saudi Arabia. This study uses a quantitative approach that collated data using a survey questionnaire from Hail city households and led to 278 completed replies. Findings depicted that age-based, gender-based and education-based digital divides do exist in Saudi Arabia. The obtained findings provide implications for the existing literature on e-Government adoption, for practitioners and policy makers.

%X Computer-synthesized speech is emerging as a mainstream human-computer interface in post-PC devices. However, there is limited research on its effect on the user experience.  We contribute to this emerging stream by focusing on online review persuasiveness. The current presentation standard is the text review accompanied by images and numeric ratings. We review the limited theory on the effect of synthesized speech on users and report preliminary results from a lab experiment. Our findings suggest that varying the message presentation, from text to speech, improves the persuasiveness of online reviews through stronger trust beliefs, attitude toward the subject of the review and purchase intention. However, they don’t support the most intuitive explanation for why: that synthesized speech increases user perceptions of trustworthiness, expertise, credibility and similarity of the source. If confirmed, our results would call for an exciting search for the mechanisms by which speech interfaces increase the persuasiveness of massages.

%X Affect often influences consumers’ evaluative judgment. Not much is known about whether and how affect may play a role in human-computer interaction. This research intends to empirically evaluate an affect-eliciting design feature (i.e., danmaku commentary presentation), and examine its effects on consumers’ evaluative judgment. Drawing on the affective response model, we hypothesize that danmaku (vs. separate) commentary presentation system may elicit more pleasant and exciting video watching experience, which in turn influence consumers’ judgmental evaluations. We further investigate whether the impact of commentary presentation systems on evaluative judgment may be contingent upon sentiment divergence of comments, consumer involvement and consumer metamotivational state. We describe an experiment design for testing the hypotheses, and discuss the potential theoretical and practical implications of this study.

%X Self-service business intelligence (SSBI) enables executives, managers, analysts and knowledge workers to access data and build reports based on their needs to support decisions and actions toward business success. From an industrial level perspective, this suggests that business users not only consume information but that they are also able to author information. Yet, there is lack of knowledge on how SSBI extends the role of a business user beyond being an information consumer. Because SSBI falls firmly under the category of self-service technologies (SST) we draw our conclusions based on a literature review on SST. This study highlights ease of use, trust, independence, control and self-efficacy as the main characteristics that are needed to generate outcomes in terms of co-production and time efficiency at an individual level.

%X We examine whether psychological contract theory and social response theory can explain users’ responses to e-commerce recommendation agents (RAs). Theories of social response to technology, trust in technology, and technology adoption are used to adapt psychological contract theory to explain user-RA relationship. We theorize that a psychological contract breach will cause a negative emotional reaction, called a psychological contract violation, which, via trust and usefulness perceptions, will influence users’ intentions to follow an RAs’ recommendation. We tested our theory using a sample of 426 participants across three studies.  Using a sample of 103 participants, Study 1 elicited perceived user-RA obligations, which form the basis for the posited psychological contract. Using a sample of 102 participants, Study 2 demonstrated a significant effect of breaching these obligations on theorized emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions to the RA using experimental RAs.  Using a sample of 221 subjects, Study 3 confirmed our findings.

Our study was held in collaboration with a leading business-to-business (B2B) corporation in Mainland China, which acts as an intermediary to connect local manufacturers to overseas corporate buyers. Three years of empirical data on the firm’s CRM has just been collected. Applying survival analysis, we conducted a pilot examination of the dataset, which unveiled the factors influencing the contract renewal of the local manufacturers. The results show that the frequency of utilizing the online FtF (FacetoFace) channel has a positive relationship with the probability of contract renewal. However, in contrast to what is commonly held, we identify negative relationship between the frequency of utilizing offline sales visits or online indirect inquiries and contract renewal probability.

%X Due to the high degree of uncertainty and risks present in the initial adoption of self-service technologies, trust in technology plays a central role in determining customers’ acceptance and adoption of technology. This paper investigates the influence of discrete emotions toward using a self-service technology on trust in the technology. Drawing on the cognitive appraisal theory and affect-as-information theory, this paper formulates a theoretical framework positing that the cognitive appraisals of technology usage outcome’s desirability and causal agency are the key determinants of emotions toward using the technology, which in turn influence trust in the technology. This paper provides a new framework to investigate the relationship between emotions and trust in technology and the findings of this research are expected to inform better technology design with the goal of maximizing trust in technology.

%X Increasing concerns about climate change mean that more and more enterprises hare adopting green strategies that complement their business, operations, and asset strategies. In addition, as information technology (IT) has permeated business processes and supply chains, the use of socalled Green IT can offer an important way to alleviate climate change reduce costs, and improve their public image. The key points with regard to the use of such technology are employee satisfaction and their continuance usage intention of Green IT. This study thus adopts the expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) to develop a research model that examines the continuance intention to use Green IT. The research hypotheses derived from this model will be empirically validated using the data collected from employees of organizations that use Green IT. The research results are expected to shed lights on how the key influencing factors of green IT usage, including perceived value, disconfirmation of value, perceived service quality, and disconfirmation of service quality, may influence user satisfaction and continuance intention to use such IT in organizations. As a result, the results of this study can provide managers with guidelines regarding promoting the use of Green IT in their organizations.

%X The traditional Dutch auction usually sets the starting price but does not set the final price. The effects and impact factors on the seller’s revenue have not been discussed if the final price of online Dutch auction is set to a teeny number (i.e., one RMB) which is termed as an one-RMB Dutch auction. Based on the regret theory and related literature, the effects of starting price, time pressure (one day and 15 minutes of time interval respectively) and product perishability on buyers' choice behavior and the revenue of sellers were examined. The results showed that there is a negative effect coming from the starting price, time pressure and perishability of products and the overall discount rate of product auction; and buyers are more inclined to bid in the penultimate round of the price reduction cycle.

%X In recent years, with the continuous development of E-commerce, the third-party online payment pattern is gaining increasingly popularity among users. Characterized by its convenience, high-credibility and safety, it has become the mainstream pattern of online payment. With its rapid development, the third-party online payment has drawn more and more attention among people from all circles. And the focus of the attention is on the risks of using this platform. In this paper, the author introduces the present development status of the third-party online payment. On the basis of that, the paper focuses on the risk analysis and supervision in the process of operation by employing scenario analysis and list technique. In order to prevent and control risks in the third-party online payment, we should study the third-party online payment market thoroughly and take all aspects into consideration. It will shape a healthy and stable development trend only when all parties related work cooperatively.

%X Signaling theory has compellingly demonstrated that embedding internet signals (i.e., web assurance seals, privacy policies, consumer feedback) by cloud service providers can be considered as credible indicators of provider’s attributes, thereby reducing uncertainties and information asymmetries in cloud service markets. However, cloud service providers are operating in a dynamic environment characterized by fast technology life cycles, ongoing service improvements, and a steady emergence of new environmental vulnerabilities. Those dynamics might threaten the long-term reliability of embedded internet signals. We believe that traditional assumptions of signaling theory might not be necessarily applicable to cloud service markets, and thus try to investigate how signal reliability can be ensured in the long run in dynamic environments. In particular, we argue that signal reliability will decline over time as cloud service providers constantly have to cope with emerging changes in the market environment resulting in a low signaling fit or low signaler’s honesty.

%X Many prior studies on the business intelligence system (BIS) adoption stories are coming from the developed countries, while recent adoption stories on the developing countries are usually from Thailand, Singapore and Philippines. Rarely, research focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being reported, especially from the developing countries such as Malaysia even after the introduction of BIS by Malaysia’s SME in September 2013. Since, SMEs are the primary drivers for national development in Malaysia, the research on the BIS adoption in SMEs is important to promote the resilient growth of SMEs. This study aims to study the BIS adoption theories and determinants as reported by prior researchers and propose the BIS adoption model for SME in Malaysia. The developed research model contains ten, enabling determinants covering four characteristics: technological innovation, environment, organization, and CEO. The findings revealed that out of ten determinants, only six are relevant to the decision-making in BIS adoption.

%X With the prevalence of online reviews, consumers are more inclined to be exposed to an unwieldy glut of information. In contrast to the research on the outcomes of online reviews, recent studies have shifted attention to the antecedents of online reviews, particularly investigating what characteristics lead to a review that is perceived more helpful by online consumers. Our research model of online review helpfulness is built upon a rich stream of literatures demonstrating how people are persuaded and influenced by information, especially the dual process theories. In this study, we specifically focus on the effect of heuristic factors: rating deviation with existing reviews’ average rating, and peer recognitions of the reviewer including network centrality and “elite” status. The model is empirically tested based on 16343 reviews of hotels from Yelp.com using zero-inflated negative binomial regression. Empirical results indicated that, in addition to a review’s content attributes, rating deviation and peer recognitions of the reviewer also have significant impacts on consumer perceptions of review helpfulness. These findings add new theoretical insights into the research of online review helpfulness, and offer practical implications for online review providers to have a better prediction of valuable reviews.

%X Using the 419,194 customers of a mobile operator as the sample, this research investigates the effectiveness of the company’s retention strategies. It examines the effect of such strategies on extending customer life cycle. We find that the retention policies and the incremental average revenue per user (ARPU) in the retention period over the month prior are positively correlated. In addition, the correlation between the retention polices and the increments of consumer consumption variables, such as the number of calls, the number of short messages and the value-added services, are also positive. Moreover, the significantly positive interaction terms between the retention bonus and the consumption increments suggest that the bonus affects the relative ARPU through the consumption variables. Finally, the retention strategies demonstrate the different effectiveness according to the three different calling plans. The managerial implications of our findings are discussed.

%X The sharing economy is continuously changing the hospitality industry while competing with incumbent businesses over the available market share. This study examines the peer-to-peer hospitality platform Airbnb. In particular, we investigate how social motives, trust, and perceived risk of private and business customers, alter the accommodation providers’ intentions to accept a booking request. Understanding the different perception of private and business customers is key – not only for platform providers, but also for researchers investigating the sharing economy. Our study employs survey data (n = 179) and covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). We find that social motives have a distinct impact on the accommodation providers’ intentions to accept a private customer. Consistent with the predictions of related literature, trust and perceived risk is identified to affect the accommodation providers’ intentions in the sharing economy. Academic and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

Based upon the systems theory and social capital theory, this study develops an explanatory model to explore the impacts of social capital, platform compatibility, resource integration effort, and realized synergy on value creation and user stickiness behaviors in a social media ecosystem. Empirical data are planned to be gathered from social media users to test the proposed hypotheses. The research model will be validated by using the structural equation modelling technique. The findings are expected to shed light on how social media platform managers can leverage platform compatibility, resource integration effort, realized synergy of social media platforms to enhance the impact of social capital on value creation, thereby leading to users’ stickiness within a social media ecosystem.

%X Although consumer profiling advocates tout benefits from personalization, consumer advocacy groups oppose profiling in online markets because of concerns about privacy and price discrimination. Policies such as opt-out or opt-in that provide consumers the option to voluntarily participate in profiling are the favored compromise. We compare voluntary profiling to no profiling and show that voluntary profiling leads to some counterintuitive results. Consumers that do not participate in profiling and some that participate are worse off under voluntary profiling. Neither social welfare nor aggregate consumer surplus is necessarily higher under voluntary profiling; even when voluntary profiling leads to an increase in social welfare, it may come at the expense of consumer surplus. If the seller cannot price discriminate and charge only a uniform price for everyone or the seller can only charge different prices based on the consumer’s participation status, then aggregate consumer surplus under voluntary profiling is higher and a reduction in privacy cost has a positive impact on all consumers as well as the seller. However, when personalized pricing is possible, reducing privacy cost alone may reduce aggregate consumer surplus. The primary reason for these results is that voluntary profiling allows the seller to identify high valuation consumers that have no incentive to participate and set a higher price for them (compared to no profiling) while simultaneously benefitting from the profile information of low valuation consumers that participate. However, a positive privacy cost mitigates the participation incentives of even low valuation consumers and hence sellers’ ability to engage in price discrimination.

%X We incorporate two streams of IS research: 1) the quality of the systems in determining systems success and 2) the effects of online incidents including online waiting interruptions and service failures on consumer behaviors, to understand three post-adoption behaviors in the use of digital media; continuance intention, recommendation, and complaint. We investigate digital media use from the perspectives of affective events theory and U & G motivations. The results of PLS analysis with 415 responses from an online survey suggest that usage behaviors are determined by perceived site quality and cognitive appraisal of incidents handling (CAIH) and satisfaction mediated the effect of positive and negative affects to post-adoption behaviors. Information and Entertainment motivations are two salient motivations of digital media use. However, interactivity shows no effect to satisfaction of digital media use. CFA and path analysis attest the dimensionality of constructs and the structure relationships of the integrated model.

%X This paper explores consumers trust in sustainable product and certification information included in the product’s package and label by using Azjen’s theory of planned behavior as a framework. We used 327 observations collected from an international survey distributed to students in the U.S., Mexico and Indonesia as proxy of consumers’ view. Our results demonstrate that the consumer’s general predisposition toward trust, social normative pressure, and the presence of factors that facilitate consumer’s perceptions to perform trust behavior significantly increase the consumer’s intention to trust sustainable product and certification information. Although we found some country variations in terms of the propensity to trust product information, the differences have no impact on the hypotheses of the theory of planned behavior. Our findings provide suggestive evidence of the instrumental roles of ICTs to facilitate sustainable development by enabling positive changes in consumer behavior, specifically in supporting sustainable consumption.

%X Social networking sites (SNSs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. These websites allow millions of individuals to create online profiles and disclose information with others. The disclosure of personal information has been considered as a major issue which can lead to negative consequences; therefore, privacy is a major concern of SNSs users. It is important to understand and measure the complexity of privacy concerns in SNSs. In this study, we investigate the nature of users’ privacy concerns in SNSs and its differences with information privacy concerns which previously studied in the setting of Internet and e-commerce. We then propose a new scale for measuring users’ privacy concerns in SNSs (UPCSNS) which will be useful for future SNSs privacy studies.

%X For the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, Lenovo, the world’s largest PC maker, had not only failed to increase its revenues and profits but also a net loss. Lenovo’s market share was still growing, but the PC market itself was shrinking by about five percent annually. Lenovo hoped to broaden its leadership toward smaller computing devices, a market that had seen more growth. It purchased Motorola Mobility in 2014 and continued to invest in its smartphone business through branding and innovation. Yet, in 2016, this business did not make a profit and only grew in some geographical markets. Lenovo faced fierce competition from giants such as Apple and Samsung and from Chinese manufacturers that had quickly grown in market share. How could Lenovo reignite growth and sustain its position as a global industry leader?

%X Users may develop a relationship with an IT service and voluntarily contribute to it. By formally establishing a connection between human-IT relationship and user voluntary contribution, this research looks into the IT service context and focuses on two issues. First, we draw on extra-role behavior literature and propose a new typology, technology extra-role behavior (TERB), for a comprehensive understanding of user voluntary contribution in the IT service context. Second, we supplement the existing works on human-IT relationship and take a psychological ownership (PO) perspective in explaining user voluntary contribution in a user-artifact relationship. Based on PO literature, we construct a research model to depict why users are willing to contribute voluntarily with the perceived psychological possession and how to design an IT service to induce this perception.

%X In ecommerce, many market followers would like to have personalization systems in place to more effectively compete with market leaders. However, retailers face a significant challenge in forming initial trust with new customers, especially when the new customers are culturally diverse. Acknowledging this dilemma, this study examines the moderating cultural effects of espoused individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance on the relationships between four different types of trust, namely, propensity to trust, institutional based trust, cognitive trust, and emotional trust, relative to the intention to use personalization system. Drawing on the theory of reasoned action, we first present different types of trust. We then develop a process model to explain how cultural differences affect types of trust. This study contributes to current literature by theoretically accounting for the impact of espoused cultural dimensions on online trust, and practically suggesting ways to increase the utilization of personalization system.

%X Retaining your customers is important for E-sellers to survive in the intensified competitive e-marketplace. We approach this issue from the perspective of “continuance intention”, a behavior intention that describes the willingness of customers to continue transacting with sellers. Drawing upon the trust-commitment theory, as well as institution-based trust factors, we examine two types of trustees, EC platform and individual E-sellers, in the process of maintaining customers in e-marketplaces. A model is theoretically developed to understand customers’ continuance intention to do business with specific E-sellers on an EC platform. An empirical study was conducted in three public universities to validate the model. The results suggest that affective commitment and calculative commitment jointly nurture customers’ continuance intention. In addition, five factors of institution-based trust strongly influence trust in EC platform, and then transfers to trust in individual E-sellers.

%X This study examines the impacts of network effect strategies, namely network structure and technology complementarity, on mobile payment (MP) loyalty. Drawing on network effect and the dedication/constraint-based model, this study proposes that network structure and technology complementarity will reinforce perceived benefits (i.e., dedication factor) and switching cost (i.e., constraint factor), which in turn formulate MP loyalty. We conduct an online survey with 318 MP users to empirically validate the model. The key findings include (1) network structure is a formative construct with size, centrality, and capability dimensions, whereas technology complementarity is a multidimensional construct with platform-application, application-service, and service-strategy elements; (2) network structure and technology complementarity exerts influences on MP loyalty through the underlying dedication-based mechanism, i.e., perceived benefits, and constraint-based mechanism, i.e., switching cost. Theoretical and practical implications and the opportunities for future research are discussed.

%X A small software company depends on its capability to adapt to rapid technological and other changes in its environment—its dynamic capabilities. In this paper, we argue that to evolve and maintain its dynamic capabilities a small software company must pay attention to the interaction between dynamic capabilities at different levels of the company—particularly between the project management and the company levels. We present a case study of a small software company and show how successful dynamic capabilities at the company level can affect project management in small software companies in ways which may have an adverse impact on the company’s overall dynamic capabilities. This study contributes to our understanding of the managerial challenges of small software companies by demonstrating the need to manage the interaction between adaptability and flexibility at different levels of the company.

In addition, this study examines the moderating effects of investors’ perceived project novelty on the relationships between motivations and citizenship behavior. Based on a sample of 226 crowdfunding investors, results indicate that internal and external motivations significantly influence investors’ citizenship behavior, which further affect investors’ stickiness intentions. Furthermore, results show that investors’ perceived project novelty moderates the relationships between internal/ external motivation and citizenship behavior.

%X Since ecommerce requires individuals to disclose their personal information, an issue of information privacy becomes an impediment towards its adoption. However, a paradox exists whereby individuals claim privacy concerns, yet act contrarily by using ecommerce. Our research aims to investigate the reasoning behind individuals use of ecommerce, despite claiming concerns for their information privacy. Based on previous findings, we argue that consumers undergo a calculation of equal benefits in conducting business with online firms, where they agree to firms utilizing their personal information as long as they retain control over its usage. This paper is a research-in-progress, and as such, our future work would be to validate our argument by collecting and empirically analyzing individuals responses with regards to ecommerce use. We expect that our paper would contribute by better understanding the conditions in which individuals disclose or withhold personal information.

%X Based on Fogg’s Functional Triad, we develop a model to explain how a feature of persuasive technologies can influence usage intention by shaping an individual’s beliefs in regard to the Functional Triad. Specifically, we operationalize the Functional Triad by adopting the constructs of perceived usefulness, perceived medium function, and perceived social presence, respectively. We investigate the trade-off transparency of an online decision aid as a persuasive feature of a computing technology. Through an experimental study, the results show that 1) perceived tool function, perceived medium function, and perceived social actor function all significantly influence intention to use a computing technology; 2) trade-off transparency influences the perceptions of these three functions; and 3) the three functions fully mediate the effect of trade-off transparency on usage intention. Implications for researchers and technology designers are also discussed.

In the increasingly competitive environment between e-commerce enterprises, the proportion of online advertising investment in total advertising investment continues to grow. However, the operating costs of enterprises are limited, in order to maximize the effectiveness of operating costs, evaluating the effect of various forms of online advertising effectively to determine the scientific online advertising budget allocation is crucial. Based on the enterprise’s Web log data, we extract the characteristic variables that represent consumer's behavior including click behavior, visit behavior and purchase behavior. On the one hand, using multivariate linear regression method to assess the short-term effect of three forms of online advertising in an overall level. On the other hand, we use logistic regression models to investigate the impact of various consumer behaviors on the purchase conversion of consumers who enter the website from different advertising channels.

%X While it has been widely documented that mobile users tend to differ from PC users in their observed behavior, such differences cannot necessarily be attributed to adoption of the mobile app because of endogeneity issues in drawing inferences from observing users who decide to adopt the mobile app. In this paper, we causally explore the changes in user behavior as well as matching outcomes due to adopting a mobile app in the online dating context. We demonstrate that once users have adopted the mobile app, they become more ubiquitous in their use and also become more socially engaged. We also find that female adopters are able to achieve more matches and become more efficient in achieving matches per each message sent. As mobile app adoption becomes widespread, understanding the causal impact on social engagement and outcomes has implications for both end users as well as businesses investing in app development.

%X While a variety of research studies have examined factors that influence individuals’ attitudes toward and use of websites, an important yet understudied stream looks at the role of website credibility. We examine website credibility through the lens of prominence-interpretation theory. Fogg (2003) developed this theory to help explain the relationships between what users observe about a website, how they interpret it, and how observation and interpretation together determine website credibility. In this paper, we look specifically at the relationship between prominence and interpretation and how these variables interact to influence attitudes about website credibility. We examined this relationship using a controlled laboratory experiment in which we exposed subjects to a website and asked them what they saw and how they interpreted what they saw. We analyzed these data using discriminant analysis and show that the interaction between prominence and interpretation accurately predicts attitudes about credibility, which offers strong support for prominence-interpretation theory. We discuss these findings and their implications for theory and practice.

%X The social media revolution has created a shift from in E-commerce to social commerce. The voice of influence is moving from traditional marketers towards social commerce communities (SCCs). This transformation allows community members to develop rich relational-related resources via digital online network. In this study, we focus on reputation building based on social capital theory in the context of social commerce community. We enhance the understanding on social capital theory in social commerce communities by identifying antecedents to contributors’ (i.e. members) community reputation. By analyzing panel data collected from a popular online forum, we found that reputation building is influenced by member centrality (structural capital), member tenure (cognitive capital), and member community reciprocity (relational capital). Of these, member centrality is the most influential factor. The study makes important contributions to research and practice.

%X The factors influencing huge divisions of wealth in society are widely studied by researchers. However, with the rapid development of the Internet, whether polarization or equalization of market shares exists in e-market among sellers springing up online, and how e-commerce affects its formation is still unknown to us. With a seller sample retrieved from Taobao, our study examines the polarization phenomenon and explores the determinants of its formation in the context of online markets. The descriptive analysis suggests a polarized phenomenon exists in e-commerce. Then this study applies quantile regression approach to investigate the factors that influence the formation of polarization in C2C mobile phone market. The results indicate that, a polarized sales distribution is existed; reputation and negative ratio play more important roles, while the number of items has a lower influence gradually. The empirical results can help us find the reason of polarization in C2C e-market.

Although the Information Systems community is engaged in significant research on IT, the reach of our findings may be limited. In this commentary, our objective is to focus the IS community’s attention on the striking transformations in economic and social systems spawned by IT and to encourage more research that offers useful implications for policy. We present examples of transformations occurring in four distinct sectors of the economy and propose policy-relevant questions that need to be addressed.  We urge researchers to write papers based on their findings that inform policy makers, managers, and decision makers about the issues that transformational technologies raise.  Finally, we suggest a new outlet to publish these essays on the implications of transformational informational technology.

%X The emergence of data-driven business models calls for their systematic design and evaluation. In this paper, we focus on a first step towards a Cost-Benefit-Analysis of data-driven business models. Within data-driven business models, data act as enabler for the development of innovative services. However, to justify internal funding of new services, an assessment of the financial impact for the service at hand is often required. We approach this by identifying drivers of cost and benefit based on the Service Business Model Canvases of twenty cases. Based on the results, all drivers and their associated models for quantification were consolidated into a single meta-model. With this, we provide a basis for the economic assessment of service ideas and their refinement during the design process.

%X The mobile phone has become an essential tool for completing purchases both online and offline. Although mobile payments (m-payments) are still in a developmental and early adoption stage, their mobility and accessibility make them likely to be one of the future’s most successful mobile services. Existing research has focused on consumer adoption, ignoring calls for merchant-centric research. Therefore, this paper presents a preliminary study on the adoption of m-payments from the merchants’ perspective. The results of the research revealed that merchants’ have an overarching affinity for financial institutions providing m-payment services and that lack of knowledge and lack of critical mass are the dominant barriers of merchants’ adoption of m-payment systems. Based on the results several recommendations for practitioners are offered and a number of lines for further research are identified.

%X Consumers' trust beliefs are considered amongst the most important psychological states influencing their online behavior. Understanding the antecedents of consumer trust is thus of both academic and practical interest. Research into these antecedents has however been disconnected, and has not been integrated to provide an answer as to which are the most significant antecedents of trust. To address this problem, we synthesized the antecedents of trust in e-service through a meta-analysis of 67 previously published studies. The findings showed that structural assurance (STA), reputation (REP), perceived usefulness (PU), system quality (SYQ) and service quality (SEQ) demonstrate the strongest effect sizes on trust. Furthermore, vendor size (SIZ) and privacy protection (PRC) also affect trust, but to a lesser degree. Moreover, we found trust can be usefully integrated with constructs from the TAM and IS Success models. We considered explanations for identified heterogeneity in effect sizes through moderator analysis. We found that cultural context of the study almost moderated all the effect sizes, and certain effect sizes were also moderated by factors such as the type of e-service and the use of student samples. Results are important to guiding future e-services research and helping practitioners to better build e-service promotion strategy.

%X This research offers a theoretical model of brokered services and provides an analysis of their impact on the cloud computing market with risk preference-based stratification of client segments. The model structures the decision problem that clients face when they choose among spot, reserved and brokered services. Although all the three types of services do not indemnify the cloud services client against other kinds of service outages, due to changes in market demand, service interruptions occur most frequently in the spot market, and are lower when brokered services are offered, and no risk of inter-ruption is involved in reserved services. Based on our analysis, we show that the profitability and sus-tainability of a cloud service broker depends on its usage of reserved resources and its capability to mitigate the risk of interruptions. We further enrich our explanation through the consideration of the distribution of clients’ risk preferences and the service vendor’s pricing decisions for reserved and spot services.

%X The decline in the physical office space for travel agencies in developed countries has been accompanied with increases in e-travel services offered online. A similar revolution can be expected in developing countries, such as Vietnam. But what will drive consumer action in these countries? While linkages between corporate image and information safety have been proposed to online buying intentions, the area has research gaps, which are investigated in this paper. We used a Technology Adoption based model with corporate image and information safety, and investigated e-travel services adoption among Vietnamese students. Our sample consists of 548 responses obtained from a survey conducted at a university in Vietnam. The results show that information safety, but interestingly not corporate image, links to e-travel services adoption. We discuss the reasons and propose future research opportunities in this area.

%X Sharing economy platforms drive new consumption habits in the hospitality industry by attracting individuals through modern technologies and innovative business models. In this study, we examine the relationship between trust, perceived risk, and the consumers’ intention to request an accommodation on the non-monetary hospitality platform Couchsurfing. We further separate intermediary and corresponding users from each other to investigate the influence of the two-sided market mechanisms on the consumers’ intention. Based on a survey of 248 consumers, we propose a research model and perform structural equation modeling. Our results indicate that the influence of trust on the consumers’ intention is fully mediated by perceived risk. Further, our results show that perceived risk of the intermediary and the corresponding users influences the consumers’ intentions, despite the sharing service being free-of-charge. This study contributes to the sharing economy literature by demonstrating the important role of perceived risk on non-monetary sharing economy platforms.

%X A market anomaly (or market inefficiency) is a price distortion typically on a financial market that seems to contradict the efficient-market hypothesis. Such anomalies could be calendar, technical or fundamental related and have been shown empirically in a number of settings for financial markets. This paper extends this stream of research to two-sided auction platforms in Electronic Commerce and empirically analyzes whether calendar anomalies are persistent on such markets. Our empirical study analyzes 78,068 transactions completed between buyers and sellers on a German auction platform and covers the period between April 2005 and May 2009. We observe a persistent turn-of-the-month effect and a day-of-the-week effect that would allow buyers to realize small additional surpluses (0.3% price discount). Prices are also persistently lower in the highly competitive Christmas trade period while sellers benefit from higher prices at the beginning of every year. Overall our results support the common notion that two-sided auction platforms are rather efficient markets on which we however can observe some marginal market inefficiencies.

%X It has been widely accepted that distrust is qualitatively different from trust. Yet scholarly knowledge about the antecedents of distrust is scarce, while the antecedents of trust have received extensive attention. Furthermore, little empirical research has explored how website factors impact on the formation of distrust in a user. Drawing upon the review of distrust literature and competence-motive perception, we propose a new theoretical framework to explain how website factors impact on perceptions of the attributes of a given website, which in turn form user distrust. In this research, distrust is triggered by website evaluations in two areas, namely malevolence and incompetence. These two attributes are determined by three website factors: lack of structural assurance, interface design, and lack of third-party recognition. The proposed research model of distrust formation in the online context is verified by an online survey with 283 valid responses. We offer theoretical and practical implications for our findings.

%X User reviews have become a popular source to assess the quality of products in consumers' purchasing decision. New insights into the effect of user reviews on product sales can be derived from examining review credibility and author popularity in our example of book sales from Amazon.com. We found that (1) average rating of reviews and diversity of ratings positively affect book sales, but (2) high diversity weakens the effect to sales, showing a quadratic effect of diversity on sales. In addition, our results suggest evidence that (3) review credibility and author popularity moderate the positive association of average rating of reviews and diversity of ratings on sales. Finally, (4) consumers seem to pay more attention to reviews for digital books than for paper books.

%X Mobile payment is the activity in which a monetary transaction is made through a mobile device, it has been experiencing impressive growth in recent years. It is not only a means of payment, but also a way to increase consumersâ€™ willingness to pay. Mobile payment generates positive business outcomes including higher revenues and increased hiring. Although mobile payment is strategically important for merchants to achieve their financial goals, very few researches systematically studied merchantsâ€™ adoption of mobile payment. The missing knowledge makes it hard to understand what influence merchantsâ€™ decision on the adoption of mobile payment. This study extracted 172 mobile payment related papers from three reputable databases, 32 of them were included in this study as they focus on organizations. A systematic analysis on those included papers identified the factors that impact merchantsâ€™ adoption.

%X Website localization is important for companies to do business in the international market. This paper-in-progress explores website localization strategies and their effects. Drawing from social identity paradigm, we develop two website localization strategies: Similarity strategy (leveraging similarities with local people to positively influence consumer attitude towards foreign companies’ websites in website design) and Prosocial strategy (bringing benefits to local people to enhance consumer attitude towards foreign companies’ websites in website design). We also propose hypotheses about how these two strategies affect perceived website localization, trust and purchase intention through perceived similarity and perceived support. An experimental study will be conducted to validate the hypotheses in Mainland, China.

%X Business to Business (B2B) sales forecast can be described as a decision-making process, which is based on past data (internal and external), formalized rules, subjective judgment, and tacit organizational knowledge. Its consequences are measured in profit and loss. The research focus of this paper is aimed to narrow the gap between planned and realized performance, introducing a novel model based on machine learning techniques. Preliminary results of machine learning model performance are presented, with focus on distilled visualizations that create powerful, yet human comprehensible and actionable insights, enabling positive climate for reflection and contributing to continuous organizational learning.

%X This paper presents an empirical investigation of a Social CRM performance model within an organizational perspective. A constraining factor regarding the implementation of Social CRM and the achievement of its objectives is the lack of an appropriate performance model. Little research has been conducted on a corresponding holistic approach and on the development of formative performance constructs. To address this gap, the article develops and empirically evaluates a Social CRM performance  model,  including  an  infrastructure-,  process-,  customer-  and organizational performance construct. The data is analyzed using a structural equation model with a surveying sample of 126 marketing, communication and IT decision makers. The results show that infrastructure performance has an indirect, process performance a direct and customer performance no association with organizational performance. The Social CRM performance model generates deeper insights into a company’s performance interrelationship and provides a control system, in order to assess Social CRM activities and enhance organizational performance.

%X Open E-Logistics Standards (OELS) is important to facilitate the integration of the supply chain. In OELS, the transmission and the manipulation of data are governed by open data and process standards that define their format, structure, and the semantics of data flow between trading partners. Despite the significant investments made by governments and leading firms, there remain concerns about OELS’ slow development progress and low adoption rates. The potential failure of OELS represents a significant stumbling block for governments and supply chain practitioners who have envisioned a globalized supply chain network electronically enabled by OELS. Researchers are also concerned about the inadequate models that are used to explain and understand the adoption of OELS. Although analysing adopter configurations in what is known as configuration analysis has been examined in disciplines related to science and economics, its application in the study of OELS remains sparse. This research aims to integrate multiple theoretical views, and apply configuration analysis with an improved methodological approach in order to examine OELS diffusion decisions and processes. The project will result in a new algorithm integrating structural equation modelling and neural network, and a decision support system which helps firms improve their OELS adoption decision.

%X In this study, we investigate how IT-enabled service augmentation influences customer satisfaction for cell phone services in Base-of-the-Pyramid (BOP) markets. We conceptualize value added service and customer care as two components of service augmentation. In spite of the acknowledged competitive significance of digital services, the impact of service augmentation on customer satisfaction remains an unexplored area of research.  Arguing for price- and relational- evaluations, we develop hypotheses for a substitution effect of value added services, and a complementary effect of customer care, on the relationship between core service and customer satisfaction.  Specific to the BOP market context, we argue for a differentiated influence of service augmentation for different categories of providers.  We empirically examine and find support for the hypothesized relationships using an archival data set from surveys of cell phone customers in seven South Asian BOP markets.  We discuss the managerial implications and contributions of the findings.

%X Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is advancing, and its application are widely used in many fields. AI chatbots powered by natural language processing are being integrated in numerous industries. AI chatbots help to improve customer services and enhance customer experiences. There is lack of study about the interactions between human and chatbots. As chatbots are designed to make interactions that are closer and more personal to the user, the way users communicate and interact with chatbots will differ from non-AI machines. Based on self-determination theory, this research aims to study the differences in system satisfaction between chatbot system and website system, and what factors determine satisfaction. The proposed research model hypothesizes the relationship between perceived autonomy, perceived competence, cognitive load, performance satisfaction, process satisfaction, and system satisfaction. It is proposed that the model will be tested using experimental survey.

%X The implementation of recommender systems in electronic procurement processes for service packages, consisting of product- and service components requires a consideration of strategic, tactical and operational procurement as well as information and communication technologies in value networks. Increasingly, the design of recommender systems for procurement processes in value networks is of scientific interest. The combination of different procurement processes for products and services driven by recommender systems however, includes problems. This paper shows the need for a process-oriented approach in procurement at several abstraction levels. A model for the design of the electronic procurement process in value networks to serve the identification of complex service packages and suppliers with recommender systems is described. Different process characteristics are investigated for the applicability of recommender systems in e-procurement. As an artifact this approach adjust a proposal for the recommender system-based procurement process in value networks.

%X The peer-to-peer nature of the sharing economy encourages participants to alter their behavior in ways that resemble traditional notions of emotional labor. A key element in this shift lies in the coercive nature of feedback mechanisms which condition both providers and consumers to perform emotional labor during service encounters. Using survey data from 207 sharing economy consumers in the US, we show how different facets of the feedback mechanisms employed by sharing economy services influence consumers’ emotional labor. In addition, we show how platforms and their policies matter in encouraging emotional labor, indicating the need to analyze the topic on a fine-grained level. We conclude by deriving propositions for future research and practical recommendations.

%X This paper is intended to analyze the interrelationship between the textual comment and the itemized rating in consumers' online feedback, and to study differentiations among diversified segments of consumers who leave the feedback. The data were collected from both an international top tourism service website which operates hotel booking services internationally and offers online hotel reputation feedback services, and its China host website. Based on the coded comments and itemized ratings from the dataset, our study shows that different customer segments demonstrate varied interrelationship behavioral patterns, and factors like satisfaction and contextual backgrounds will matter. The findings from this research may help hotels to develop varied marketing strategies for different segment of customers, and help online reputation sites to improve their services by distinguishing dissimilar behavioral patterns in different customer segments.

%X Database management and querying skills are a key element of a robust information systems curriculum. The data structure and content of a useful pedagogically-oriented database should be realistic and lifelike, and the database should contain data that accurately depicts the business processes, functions, and entities of a realistic organization, organized in a way that demonstrates best practices in database design. Most database textbooks include some sample databases, but these are often relatively small and sparse of data. By contrast, Microsoft’s Adventure Works (AW) database presents a robust, realistic, and comprehensive framework for many important educational objectives in an Information Systems curriculum. This paper introduces the AW business case and database, and illustrates several pedagogical uses in an undergraduate CIS program.

%X Web 2.0 has been in the foray for a while playing an important role in threading business processes, various departments, systems and key stakeholders (within firms) to activate customer participation and involvement. In order to re-emphasize customer centricity, firms have been using SCRM (Social Customer Relationship Management) approach as a part of their CRM (Customer Relationship Management) strategy. The activities under SCRM are a major source for organizational knowledge creation that occurs due to a continuous dialogue between tacit and explicit knowledge. Also, various social platforms (operating for SCRM) where collaboration takes place acts as a shared context for knowledge creation. To comprehend the actions and limitations of a knowledge-creating firm thoroughly, this research paper examines the process of knowledge-creation by (1) revisiting Nonaka-Takeuchi SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination & Internalization) process to recognize how SCRM activities can be prolific in organizational knowledge creation (2) exploring positive disruptions created by integrating SCRM activities with four modes of SECI process for additional knowledge creation (3) analyzing case studies of four firms from consumer products sector that use SCRM approach and (4) discovering the elements under SCRM approach that satisfy ‘BA’ as a shared context.

%X Group buying mode has been one of the hottest business models in the Chinese Internet area in recent years. Though the market competition is intense, the demand of group purchase is still on the rise. Nowadays, the research on comprehensive evaluation of group buying websites in our country is still tiny. The paper used DEA combined with fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to evaluate popular group buying websites. According to the characteristics of group buying websites, we evaluate the quality of group buying websites from three aspects. There are running efficiency, profit ability and promotion quality. Then we got the comprehensive evaluation results of each website. Some suggestions of website building for group purchasing enterprises are proposed.

%X The  increase  in  the  variety  of  websites,  ranging  from  information-intensive  portal,  through  social media,  to  shopping  website,  has  afforded  consumers  unprecedented  opportunity  to  make  informed purchase  decisions.  Anecdotal  evidence  indicates  that  consumers  do  spend  considerable  amount  of effort  visiting  various  online  outlets,  such  as  the  social  media  websites,  prior  to  committing  to  a purchase.  This  could  suggest  that  online  consumers  in  general  are  conscious-buyers  who  have  a tendency  to  engage  in  reasonably  wide  amount  of  product  research  beyond  the  shopping  websites. Building  on  the  selective  exposure  theory,  this  research  argues  that  online  consumers  are  selective and  focus  in  their  product research  endeavor;  specifically,  these  consumers may have  a  tendency  to biased  process  the  exposed  informational  alternatives  to  gratify  their  needs  for  purchase  through shopping  websites.  To  validate  this  proposition,  we  collaborated  with  a  Chinese  Internet-based research agency to perform a pluralistic investigation, which involves a non-obtrusive tracking of 200 Chinese consumers’ online activity and a series of post-investigation interviews.
%X In  terms  of tracking of the consumers’ activities,  our  novel  analyzing  technique,  sequence  analysis, can  be  used  to categorize  the  distinctive  clusters  of cross-website  navigations.  In  each  distinctive cluster, consumers engaging in product information retrieving activities are more likely to commit to a purchase within a visit even after taking into consideration the previous visits’ activities. Based  on previous  work,  we  argue  that  visits  to  different  types  of  information  media  influence  the  online purchase commitment variously. The subsequent interview designs with a subset of consumers will be conducted to reveal that consumers have an inclination to gratify the reasons for purchase by focusing on visiting shopping websites; while other websites serve as good avenues to gratify reasons for non-purchase in the future.

%X Following the rapid growth of mobile data services in China, the competition between mobile data service providers becomes more intensively. To gain advantage in the fierce competition, it’s very critical to service providers managing their service quality effectively, thus a comprehensive measurement instrument of service quality is needed. However, there are few studies dedicated to mobile data services in this area. Our study proposes a conceptualization framework derived from Technical Acceptance Model. Based on the framework, we develop and validate an instrument to measure perceived service quality of mobile data services in rigorous process. Finally we have gotten a service quality instrument with six-dimensions: content quality, usability, reliability and speed, interaction, entertainment/ enjoyment, security/privacy. This scale provides a useful instrument for researchers who wish to measure the service quality of mobile data services and for marketing managers who want to improve their service performance.

%X Companies increasingly are providing customer service through social media, helping customers on a real-time basis. Although some traditional call centers might prioritize customers based on their expected business values, the grounds for differential customer service on social media are unclear, since there has been little theoretical or empirical investigation of this new phenomenon. Building on the literature of social psychology and complaint management, we hypothesize two main drivers of differential treatment: the social media influence effect, which refers to the impact of the customer’s relative standing on social media, and the bystander effect, which refers to the impact of the presence of other social media users. To test these effects, we analyzed more than three million tweets to seven major U.S. airlines on Twitter from September 2014 to May 2015. The evidence is clear that airlines respond to less than half of the tweets directed at them by complaining customers—in contrast with traditional call centers, which are expected to address all callers. Interestingly, we find that the airlines are more likely to respond to complaints from customers with more followers, and customers with more followers are more likely to receive faster responses, thus confirming the existence of a concealed (or at least unpublicized) social media influence effect. We also find that airlines are less likely to respond to complaints with multiple parties mentioned, confirming the existence of the bystander effect. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper in the literature to study the existence and drivers of differential treatment when customer service is delivered on social media, and we expect our findings will have important implications for companies, customers, and regulators.

%X Social media posts created by customers capture a lot of business relevant information for decision-makers, e.g., current consumer expectations on products and services. For that purpose, the social media posts need to be analyzed thoroughly. In this respect, a topic-related classification facilitates managerial decision-making because business relevant topics, social media users discuss about, immediately become obvious and the need for action can be derived. For instance, it may get obvious that the majority of a company’s negative customer posts refers to a particular product or a specific campaign. However, such a classification of social media posts is particularly challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This is because human resources for a manual examination of posts are missing and an automatic analysis is error-prone due to particularities of customer posts such as the occurrence of regional dialect or branch-specific expressions. We thus develop a tool, which enables the automatized topic-related classification of social media posts and matches the particular requirements of SMEs in southern Germany. Our solution is evaluated by using a data set stemming from three collaborating companies.

%X The business model concept, although a relatively new topic for research, has garnered growing attention over the past decade. Whilst it has been robustly defined, the concept has so far at- tracted very little substantive research. In the context of the wide-spread dig- itization of businesses and society at large, the logic inherent in a business model has become critical for business success and, hence, a focus for aca- demic inquiry. The business model con- cept is identified as the missing link between business strategy, processes, and Information Technology (IT). The authors argue that the BISE community offers distinct and unique competen- cies (e.g., translating business strate- gies into IT systems, managing busi- ness and IT processes, etc.) that can be harnessed for significant research con- tributions to this field. Within this re- search gap three distinct streams are delineated, namely, business models in IT industries, IT enabled or digital business models, and IT support for developing and managing business models. For these streams, the cur- rent state of the art, suggest critical re- search questions, and suitable research methodologies are outlined.

%X Micro-group is a commonly used function provided by most of China micro-blog platforms though which friends or people with common interests can share conversations like an online community. In this study, we draw from established socio-technical theory in Information Systems to develop an integrated model of customers’ adherence to micro-groups from the view of switching cost. The results of the empirical analysis confirmed that switching cost increases when the user perceived that the system was secure, full-functional or when there is a high level of network size, information value and network status. In the same way, greater switching cost was also found to have a positive influence on user adherence to micro-groups. Based on the findings, strategies to help micro-group site develop an enhanced “lock-in” effect are proposed.

%X The heavy cash dependence of India and low digital payment adoption changed when the government announced its demonetization scheme on November 2016, invalidating banknotes and creating a crisis. In this cash shortage, the nation, that was historically low on mobile payment adoption, was ‘pushed’ to use digital payment. Though debit/credit cards are traditional digital options, easier to maintain in comparison to mobile wallets, the adoption rate for wallets was surprisingly higher. Environmental events occurring around the same time period include introduction of low cost Internet offering better facilitating conditions, discounts by e-wallets companies, and increased risk perception for payment cards from theft news flocking the media. We propose to investigate the various facilitating and inhibiting factors that accelerated mobile payment adoption above other digital options.

%X Information and communication technology has fostered the rise of the sharing economy, enabling individuals to share excess capacity. In this paper, we focus on Airbnb.com, which is among the most prominent examples of the sharing economy. We take the perspective of an accommodation provider and investigate the concept of trust, which facilitates complete strangers to form temporal C2C relationships on Airbnb.com. In fact, the implications of trust in the sharing economy fundamentally differ to related online industries. In our research model, we investigate the formation of trust by incorporating two antecedents – ‘Disposition to trust’ and ‘Familiarity with Airbnb.com’. Furthermore, we differentiate between ‘Trust in Airbnb.com’ and ‘Trust in renters’ and examine their implications on two provider intentions. To seek support for our research model, we conducted a survey with 189 participants. The results show that both trust constructs are decisive to successfully initiate a sharing deal between two parties.

%X Mobile application market shows an unprecedented prospect. This research employs the event study methodology to examine the short-term effect of mobile initiative on firm value in the period of 2008 to 2016.  Our findings show that overall the stock market reacts negatively to the launch of mobile apps by public firms. In addition, we find that the negative market reaction mainly comes from mobile initiative by late followers in the mobile market and small firms. This research is the first study to empirically test the value relevance of IT investment in the form of mobile app development and provides important managerial implications for companies that plan to enter the mobile app market.

%X The present study examines how gaze behavior relates with users’ expertise in evaluating the visual appeal of a website. We adopt four facets of visual aesthetics (i.e., simplicity, diversity, colorfulness, craftsmanship) and explain how ones’ expertise may change the way he or she looks at a high or low appealing website. We employ eye-tracking techniques to capture users’ gaze behavior while looking at high and low appealing e-commerce websites, on a sample of 23 users with previous experience in e-commerce. The findings show that expert users’ make more careful observations, have a deeper cognitive processing, demonstrate less anticipation, along with more local processing and engagement with the task than novices. Also, gaze behavior remains the same for both low and high appealing websites. The study contributes by providing evidence on how to capture and use gaze data from experts to train new and inexperienced users to have more accurate judgements about the aesthetics of websites, and thus improving both user experience and website design.

%X Privacy has been an enduring concern associated with commercial information technology (IT) applications, in particular regarding the issue of personalization.  IT-enabled personalization, while potentially making the user computing experience more gratifying, often relies heavily on the user’s personal information to deliver individualized services, which raises the user’s privacy concerns.  We term the tension between personalization and privacy, which follows from marketers exploiting consumers’ data to offer personalized product information, the personalization–privacy paradox.  To better understand this paradox, we build on the theoretical lenses of uses and gratification theory and information boundary theory to conceptualize the extent to which privacy impacts the process and content gratifications derived from personalization, and how an IT solution can be designed to alleviate privacy concerns.
%X Set in the context of personalized advertising applications for smartphones, we propose and prototype an IT solution, referred to as a personalized, privacy-safe application, that retains users’ information locally on their smartphones while still providing them with personalized product messages.  We validated this solution through a field experiment by benchmarking it against two more conventional applications:  a base non-personalized application that broadcasts non-personalized product information to users, and a personalized, non-privacy safe application that transmits user information to a central marketer’s server.  The results show that (compared to the non-personalized application), while personalized, privacy-safe or not  increased application usage (reflecting process gratification), it was only when it was privacy-safe that users saved product messages (reflecting content gratification) more frequently.  Follow-up surveys corroborated these nuanced findings and further revealed the users’ psychological states, which  explained our field experiment results.  We found that saving advertisements for content gratification led to a perceived intrusion of information boundary that made users reluctant to do so.  Overall our proposed IT solution, which delivers a personalized service but avoids transmitting users’ personal information to third parties, reduces users’ perceptions that their information boundaries are being intruded upon, thus mitigating the personalization–privacy paradox and increasing both process and content gratification.

%X Understanding the antecedents and consequences of trust in an online and on-demand outsourcing context is important. This study explores the effects of service quality on trust, which in turn affects a client firm’s post-adoption use in SaaS. A research model was developed based on the dedication-constraint framework of social exchange theory to measure service quality, trust, and SaaS post-adoption as multiple dimensions. We empirically examined the model by collecting data from 246 firms (key informants) that have adopted SaaS. Results show that while all three dimensions of service quality (client orientation quality, client response quality, environment quality) positively affect trust in service quality, client orientation and environment quality have positively influence on trust in provider. Both types of trust positively influence post-adoption intention. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications.

%X The success of social media websites—Web 2.0 platforms that enable users to communicate among themselves—hinges on users’ ability to generate content and respond to content supplied by others. Thus, understanding the current and expected patterns of participation among their users is a fundamental concern for the managers of social media websites. However, current prevailing prediction approaches use very simple benchmark models. We offer a novel approach for estimating the number of active users and predicting future participation. Using a unique data set from online forums, we demonstrate how probability models (specifically, the geometric/beta-Bernoulli model) traditionally used for customer loyalty analysis can be successfully used to assess participation patterns, and thus the future value of online communities.  We further explore the factors that affect the usefulness of this approach. Compared with current methods, our approach generates better estimations of future visits as well as future contribution levels.

%X With the growing development of information technology and the wireless telecommunication network nowadays, mobile devices have been expanding rapidly and have been emerging as important tools for consumers. Using m-services and applications (apps) on mobile devices becomes custom in people’s daily lives. This study proposes a theoretical model to explore the continued usage behavior for smartphone. The objective of this study is to explore how perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and confirmation influencing satisfaction and habit of consumers, and in turn influencing continued usage behavior, as well as the moderating effect of three characteristics of m-commerce. The proposed model will empirically be tested using survey method and collecting data from smartphone users in longitudinal setting. The structural equation modeling technique will be used to evaluate the causal model and confirmatory factor analysis will be performed to examine the reliability and validity of the measurement model. The findings of this study are expected to illustrate how factors influence individuals to use m-services and mobile apps and become a habit, as well as how these habits influence continued smartphone usage.

%X This research explores how manifesting a firm’s commitments to green environment and ecological sustainability by web-design elements may build online trust equity for the firm. Using an exploratory analysis of websites, we have identified four categories of web-design elements that could manifest companies’ commitment for green environment. Survey data indicates that these categories of web elements have the potential to change customers’ opinions regarding a company. To explore this potential, we propose a conceptual model that explores the relationship between the level of web vendors’ pro-environmental commitment and online trust equity as moderated by their salient environmental beliefs. The conceptualization uses the protection motivation theory as the overarching theory. This paper makes number of novel contributions. It is the first identify the categories of web-design elements that manifest companies’ extent of pro-environment commitments. It develops a theory-based conceptual model to examine the relationship between environmentally sustainable activities and online trust equity. Moreover, beyond legal compliance and cost reduction benefits, this research project seeks to examine if the commitment to green environment as manifested in web elements adds business value to companies in terms of trust equity in relationships with its stakeholders.

%X This study investigates how consumers assess the quality of two types of recommender systems, collaborative filtering and content-based, in the content of e-commerce by using a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Specifically, the under-investigated concept of trust in technological artifacts is adapted to a modified UTAUT model. Additionally, this study considers hedonic and utilitarian product characteristics, attempting to present a comprehensive range of recommender system acceptance. A total of 51 participants completed an online 2 (recommender systems) x 2 (products) survey. The results suggested that type of recommender systems and products did have different impacts on the behavioral intention to use recommender systems. This study may be of importance in explaining factors contributing to use recommender systems, as well as in providing designers of recommender systems with a better understanding of how to provide a more effective recommender system.

%X This paper presents an assessment schema for Social CRM tools based on an empirical investigation. A constraining factor regarding the implementation of Social CRM tools (e.g., Engagor, Demand Media) is a lack of corresponding comparability of the different features (e.g., analysis of individual data, CRM interface). Little research has been conducted on the assessment of Social CRM tools, and even less have used empirical investigations to develop an assessment schema for surveying the use of corresponding technologies. To address this gap, the study reveals a quantitative investigation of Social CRM technology use as well as develops an assessment schema for Social CRM tools (i.e., including a Monitoring and Capturing, Analysis, Exploitation, Communication, IS integration and Management dimension). The data is analyzed using formative indicators with a sample of 122 marketing, communication and IT decision makers. The results of the analysis serve as weights for the assessment schema. It can be used to develop values for Social CRM tools with regard to their different ‘use’ features and dimensions.

%X Firms are changing existing business models and create new business models through discovering e-business opportunities. However, how entrepreneurial perceptions can be activated to discover e-business opportunities is still underexplored. This study proposed a research model that integrated the subjectivist theory of entrepreneurship, the resource-based view and the institutional theory to explain how external pressures and IT infrastructure maturity influence entrepreneurial perceptions, which further promote the discovery of e-business opportunities. Data collected from 203 traditional firms in China was used to examine. The result supported that the causal relationships from external pressures and IT infrastructure maturity to e-business opportunity discovery are partially mediated by entrepreneurial perceptions. In addition, external pressures and IT infrastructure maturity pose different effects on three types of entrepreneurial perceptions. Practitioners looking for innovative use of e-business should view external pressures as an external driving force and IT infrastructure as an internal driving force for motivating entrepreneurial perceptions.

%X Building consumers’ trust and facilitating their usage intentions are crucial for mobile payment (MP) service providers. Drawing upon the two primary bodies of literature, the trust transfer theory and trust-based acceptance model, this study employs a trust-centric lens with a balanced cognitive and emotional perspective to investigate MP adoption. The model considers not only how cognitive and emotional trust affect consumers’ usage intention of MP, but also how to build cognitive and emotional trust through the trust transfer mechanism. We conduct a field survey with 273 responses to test the model. The results indicate that emotional trust in MP has a much stronger effect on consumers’ intention to use, while cognitive trust in MP has both direct and indirect effects on intention to use. Our findings also suggest that cognitive and emotional trust can transfer from web payment to MP. In addition, perceived entitativity between the web and mobile payment increases cognitive and emotional trust in MP. Limitations, implications for theory and practice will be discussed.

This paper discussed the intermediary function of corporate social responsibility behavior between ethical system and corporate performance, through theoretical analysis and empirical test. The object of our research was enterprise senior managers in China. We recovered 167 valid questionnaires. The result indicates that ethical system does not have positive effect on corporate performance directly, but CSR behavior both obvious positively associates with ethical system and corporate performance. The CSR behavior is a mediating variable between ethical system and corporate performance. This research is an important part of CSR research, it strengths the importance of ethical system building.

Rare studies investigated the impact of social psychological factors on the usage of Facebook and the formation of quality relationship. The objective of this paper is to examine the key social psychological factors to better explain the formation of quality relationship. Our proposed theoretical model combined the theories of social influence, social identity, and social presence to capture the essences of the relationship quality between users and Facebook. We conducted a survey to collect data and empirically test our proposed model. Overall, our findings provide theoretical insights to explain the influence of social psychological factors on the usage of Facebook and quality relationship. These findings also help practitioners to plan marketing strategies in better utilize social network sites.

%X The Social Web is transforming the relationship between companies and customers. It offers the means to redesign the fundamental structure of customer service systems and to refocus on the relationship aspect of customer relationship management (CRM). Although various examples illustrate how companies may use Social Media in the field of CRM, the necessary IT systems are still open for research. This paper investigates the use of Social Media in CRM processes and their functional requirements using a collection of case studies from the literature. The findings show that firms may use Social Media in several forms to enhance their CRM processes, but also that Social Media-specific processes arise that require dedicated functionalities in the field of Social Media monitoring, management and interaction.

%X Sharing economy is becoming increasingly popular, which brings many benefits to consumers and society. However, these are many failure cases in this industry. Customer cooperation largely affects the success and performance of sharing economy. As customers are involved in the service delivery process, firms should encourage customers to co-create value. Drawn from organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) theory, this study defines value co-creation in terms of in-role and extra-role participation. For enhancing user participation, this study further take the institutional perspective grounded in service-dominant (S-D) logic to provide a framework regarding deterrence and reciprocity approaches for enhancing user participation. Regarding deterrence approach, perceived sanction certainty, severity, and celerity as well as perceived effectiveness of legal protection can increase rule compliance intention, which in turn increases in-role participation. Regarding reciprocity approach, perceived relationship investment can enhance user satisfaction and user role identification, which in turn promotes user in-role and extra-role participation.

%X The remarkable growth of crowdfunding has sparked academic interest. By collecting small contributions from a large number of individuals, entrepreneurs, artists and other individuals and organizations can raise considerable amounts of money. Despite the increasing academic interest in this topic, there still appears to be a lack of understanding regarding the factors that determine individuals’ intentions to contribute to projects. In this research-in-progress paper, we propose a research model that examines future funding intentions by using Expectation-Disconfirmation Theory (EDT). By applying our research model to reward-based crowdfunding, we intend to shed light on the ways in which previous funding experiences influence future funding intentions. Through the data collected by this study, our research will contribute to the body of literature on reward-based crowdfunding and EDT. It will also provide practical implications for crowdfunding platforms and project initiators, providing them indications for their management of expectations.

%X Companies are encouraging and incentivizing contributors of online word-of-mouth (WOM) through gamification elements such as badges, mayorships, points, and such. We study how gamification elements, which capture and signal contributors’ accumulated expertise, affect consumers’ perception of contributors’ knowledge, and therefore the perceived effectiveness of their contributed WOM. We focus on two specific gamification elements on Foursquare: badges, which signal breadth of knowledge, and mayorships, which signal depth of knowledge. Using experiments conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we find: (1) badges and mayorships that appear alongside contributors’ online WOM, provide a unique way to signal WOM contributors’ knowledge and therefore have an impact on the perceived effectiveness of such WOM; (2) the impact of badges on perceived WOM effectiveness is higher than that of mayorships. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing research on the impact of gamification and also suggest ways for firms to benefit from gamification.

Several studies have already been conducted on this topic for understanding antecedents of digital payments adoption. However, none of the existing research has been undertaken to understand the cumulative impact of trust and risk as predictors and antecedents in the digital payment adoption research. Therefore, this study is aimed to perform the meta- analysis of various factors that influence trust and risk and the impact of these two factors on to behavioral intentions and user satisfaction. The findings of this research would help the researchers toward using trust, risk and their associated factors as potential constructs in the future conceptual model in the digital payment adoption research.

%X The advent of peer-to-peer accommodation sharing platforms, like Airbnb, has ushered in a new era in travel worldwide. However, to ensure sustainability in the long term, information asymmetry inherent to such platforms has to be tackled. Currently, accommodation sharing platforms offer a multitude of in-built trust-enhancing cues that may reduce information asymmetry, signal trust and aid potential guests in their decision making. Nevertheless, little is known about the effectiveness of these cues in shaping online consumption behavior. Building on the Signalling Theory, this study explores the effectiveness and monetary value of three groups of trust-enhancing cues commonly deployed by service providers to promote trust in the sharing economy via a discrete choice experiment methodology. Findings from our study not only contribute to extant literature on the effectiveness of trust-enhancing cues, but they also empower platform providers and hosts through novel insights on how the performance of their offerings is evaluated by consumers.

%X Electronically mediated self-service technologies in the banking industry have impacted the way banks service consumers. Despite a large body of research on electronic banking channels, no study has been undertaken to empirically explore the fit between electronic banking channels and banking services. To address this gap, we developed and validated a service-channel fit conceptualization and an associated survey instrument. We applied a mixed methods approach and initially investigated industry experts’ perceptions regarding the concept of ‘service-channel fit’ (SCF). The findings demonstrated that the concept was highly valued by bank managers. Next, we developed an instrument to measure the perceived service-channel fit of electronic banking channels. The instrument was developed using expert rounds and two pretests involving approximately 300 consumers in New Zealand. Drawing on IS alignment literature, we created a parallel instrument allowing us to calculate SCF across three unique fit dimensions, including service complexity-channel fit, service importance-channel fit, and service routineness-channel fit. To explore the nomological validity of the SCF construct, we linked SCF to customers’ intention to use a specific channel for a particular banking task. We tested our model with data from 340 consumers in New Zealand using Internet banking applications for two different banking tasks. The results of our study have theoretical and practical implications for how clients should be serviced through electronically mediated Banking channels.

%X Social shopping allows potential buyers to obtain information and opinions issued by other buyers with similar profiles, on products and services they are planning to acquire. On another hand, under companies’ point of view, social shopping offers them a way to analyze the market and detect consumers’ tendencies. In the present article we propose a model that expands the models of current social shopping by adding the possibility of the community to procede to self determination of the products and services basket, by determining what they want to buy, and in some occasions, when. This way, instead of allowing a brand or product to create in the community users the need or will to buy, it is the community itself, through social networks, to self-influence in the sense of defining what are the products and services they want to be marketed and in what way, thus obtaining better prices and reaffirming its identity.

%X The business model (BM) concept has gained increasing attention and popularity in both practice and research. In this context, the term “digital BM” emerged as a real buzzword, even though there still seems to be little consensus on what this term actually means and how it can be conceptualized. For example, most existing conceptualizations do not take into account the specific features of digital BMs or present domain-specific taxonomies of such BMs. To address this shortcoming, our study reviews prior literature and follows established guidelines to develop a taxonomy of digital BMs as they relate to both born-online and born-offline companies. To illustrate the usefulness of our taxonomy, we present four mini-cases and classify their digital BMs along the taxonomy dimensions. Our study contributes to the literature by furthering our understanding of the digital BM concept as well as by strengthening the conceptual basis for future research in the area.

Named SellerScope, this application addresses many shortcomings of existing salesforce management-related offerings, including the difficulty of use, the lack of interactivity, the lack of timeliness in information reaching stakeholders, and the limited combined analysis of disparate enterprise data. The various data and analytics solutions are described in the paper. The interface is shown through screenshots in the paper, and also in animated form in an accompanying video. The business innovations of the application and the ways in which the visual interface facilitates understanding and trust by the user are discussed.

%X Mobile applications continue to experience explosive growth. Using mobile apps often requires disclosing location data--often along with various other forms of private information. Existing research has implied that consumers are willing to accept privacy risks for relatively smaller benefits and the mobile app context appears to be no different. In other words, consumers do not demonstrate perfect rationality regarding their valuation of risks and benefits regarding mobile app information disclosure. This study employs a theoretical lens based on privacy calculus, but integrated with prospect theory and intertemporal choice to explain how and why this "bounded" rationality occurs in information disclosure decisions through mobile apps. It reports the results of a controlled experiment involving consumers (n=1025) in a range of ages, education, and employment experience based on actual information disclosure. We find that consumers undervalue the probability of risks and have difficulty separating their existing risk exposure from potential new threats.

%X Although trust and distrust are both crucial in online truster-trustee relationships, researchers disagree as to whether trust and distrust are distinct from each other. Given this debate, it is important to consider how distrust could be distinguished from trust. Accordingly, this paper extends the nomological network of distrust and introduces two novel antecedents never introduced in e-commerce literature: situational abnormalities and suspicion. We also propose that trust and distrust coexist in an online e-commerce relationship and can result in ambivalence when they both have high attitudinal values (represented in emotions, beliefs, or behaviours).
%X Using a study of online consumer behaviour with 521 consumers, we largely validated our newly proposed model. We find that situational abnormalities and suspicion are separate, important novel antecedents to distrust. We also examine the effect of ambivalence on the truster’s intentions towards the website and find a small positive effect that increases the user’s intentions towards the website. Finally, we demonstrate the coexistence of trust and distrust as separate constructs, and highlight that distrust has a much larger impact on the truster’s intentions than trust. We conclude with implications to theory and practice, along with a discussion of the limitations and future opportunities.

%X With the emergence of new technologies, in particular the Internet, the opportunity for impulsive purchases have expanded enormously. In this research-in-progress, we report the current status of an fMRI-project in which we investigated differences between neural processes in the brains of impulsive and non-impulsive shoppers during the trustworthiness evaluation of online offers. Both our behavioral and fMRI data provide evidence that the impulsiveness of individuals can exert significant influence on the evaluation of online offers, and can potentially affect subsequent purchase behavior. We show that impulsive individuals evaluate trustworthy and untrustworthy offers differently than do non-impulsive individuals. With respect to brain activation, both experimental groups (i.e., impulsive, non-impulsive) exhibit similar neural activation tendencies, but differences exist in the magnitude of activation patterns in brain regions that are closely related to trust and decision making, such as the DLPFC, the insula cortex, and the caudate nucleus.

%X Becoming  members  of  social  networking  websites  is  now  one  of  the  most  popular  on-line  activities. Although  the  number  of  users  has  been  growing  exponentially  in  social  network  sites  (SNS),  some SNSs  are facing a  financial  crisis  and  might  be shut down  in the  near future.  Therefore,  understand users’ incentives to switch to another SNS has great influence on operators’ business performance. The study extended “Push-Pull” migratory theory to explain the switching behaviors of users in SNS. Structural  equation  modeling  (SEM)  was  applied  to  analyze  data  collected  from  618  users  by questionnaire survey. The result shows that pull effects have the greatest influence on users’ switching behaviors, followed by push effects. As a result, the study suggests that operators should satisfy users’ pursuit of freshness, and carefully examine whether their services could address users’ needs of socializing and entertainment

%X Governments  are making  significant  investments in  information  technology  to  transform the  way  in which  they  serve  their  stakeholders  e.g.,  businesses  and  citizens.  Going  beyond  early  efforts  of automating existing services, government agencies are seeking for opportunities to use IT to enhance citizen involvement and participation. With the advent of Web 2.0, Gov 2.0 has gained popularity with promises  of  co-creation  of  value  with  citizens and  businesses and  harnessing  the  power  of  mass collaboration.
%X As a step towards a “Gov-for-you” orientation, government agencies have attempted to promote user participation in Gov2.0 activities. However, there is still a lack of understanding of how government agencies can facilitate businesses and citizens to co-create value. In addition, it is unclear if citizens and businesses will adopt these Gov2.0 services.
%X With the limited understanding and research in this area, this paper proposes two models in response to the gaps. First, it applies the theoretical perspectives of resource-based view and value co-creation to obtain a  deeper  understanding of how  government  agencies  can  facilitate  users  (businesses  and citizens)  to participate.  Second,  we  apply  the  perspective  of  service  acceptance  to explain  the antecedents of adoption of Gov2.0 services. Together, these two models expect to inform research and practice on Gov2.0, an increasing trend in e-government.

%X Business intelligence (BI) combined with business analytics (BA) is an increasingly prominent strategic objective for many organizations. As a pedagogical subject, BI/BA is still in its infancy, and, in order for this to mature, we need to develop an undergraduate model BI/BA curriculum. BI/BA as an academic domain is emerging as a hybrid of disciplines, including information systems, statistics, management science, artificial intelligence, computer science, and business practice/theory. Based on IS 2010’s model curriculum constructs (Topi et al., 2010), we explore two curricular options: a BI/BA concentration in a typical IS major and a comprehensive, integrated BI/BA undergraduate major. In support, we present evidence of industry need for BI/BA, review the current state of BI/BA education, and compare anticipated requirements for BI/BA curricula with the IS 2010 model curriculum. For this initial phase of curricular design, we postulate a preliminary set of knowledge areas relevant for BI/BA pedagogy in a multi-disciplinary framework. Then we discuss avenues for integrating these knowledge areas to develop professionally prepared BI/BA specializations at the undergraduate level. We also examine implications for both AACSB and ABET accreditation and describe the next phase of applying the IS 2010 concept structure to BI/BA curriculum development.

%X User privacy and self-disclosure perspectives have been studied in great detail within e-commerce and social networking contexts. While many earlier studies consider online user base religion- agnostic, this study bridges the gap in the literature by addressing the user behaviour factors associated with religious beliefs. The specifics of user behaviour influenced by religion, particularly fundamental Islam, are yet to be fully understood by current research. This paper investigates the effect of religion on the online privacy and self-disclosure on social platforms. We propose a model linking religious beliefs, privacy behaviour and self-disclosure and empirically test it. By using PLS-SEM, intrinsic religiosity (ROS), communication privacy management (CPM) is shown to influence self-disclosure. The results show that religion has an indirect effect on the self-disclosure through privacy concerns. The implications of this study are significant for policy and practice for social media companies and users.

%X Online customer reviews (OCRs) have become an important part of online customers’ decision making and People use online reviews to make decision to buy or not to buy products and services. This study aims to answer two research questions: (1) what are the antecedents of helpfulness of online reviews based on their contents? (2) How do content-based cues on OCRs influence their helpfulness? We posit a research model to study the effect of peripheral and central cues in OCRs on online review helpfulness. Online review web pages will be collected from Amazon website using a web crawler. This article will be one of the first studies that investigate OCRs helpfulness based on the central cues in the text of the review. In addition, this research will be the first study that applied the support vector machine as a machine learning method to analyze the text of OCRs.

%X Service value networks (SVNs) are a new form of industrial cooperation. Within SVNs, service providers engage in loosely coupled relationships to jointly offer dynamically configured complex services to customers. Value is co-created through these joint complex services. By specialization, service providers leverage the knowledge and capital assets of their partners, and share the risk of operating in a changing and uncertain environment. However, as a new approach, SVNs lack theoretical foundations and empirical studies to validate its applicability. This paper seeks to address these problems by making three contributions. First, based on an existing theoretical SVN model, the paper presents a design for a mobile phone video service value network (MPVSVN) in China. Second, we describe a systematic approach to calculate the value and utility of services on the SVN. Third, we demonstrate our approach in detailed steps through real world service examples identified from the MPVSVN.

%X This research-in-progress paper studies the active and passive usage of mobile instant messaging (MIM) applications. Grounded on two-factor theory and three-factor theory, we propose the features of MIM applications influence the active/passive usage of MIM applications through users’ satisfaction and dissatisfaction. The proposed features are categorized into three factors: exciting factors which contain design aesthetics, customization and enjoyment, performance factors which include sociability, convenience and privacy assurance, and basic factors which are application costs and technical functionality. To test hypothetical relationships in this study, we plan to use a survey method. The potential implications to both literature and practice are discussed.

%X This study aims to investigate the level of user satisfaction with the services provided by e-government portals and to examine the influence of perceived value and virtual community engagement on citizens’ satisfaction and their continuous and extended use intentions. Primary data were collected from 409 users of e-government portals via a questionnaire survey. The findings show that citizens are generally satisfied with the services provided by e-government portals and have positive continuous use and extended use intentions. The actual usage is more prevalent among educational, banking and finance, and taxation related portals. Both perceived value and virtual community engagement relate positively with citizen satisfaction, with the former has a relatively stronger influence. Citizen satisfaction also leads to continuous and extended use intentions. The findings shed lights on dimensions of e-government portals that citizens considered valuable and the importance of the formation of virtual communities in influencing their satisfaction and subsequent use intentions.

%X A sub-area of business analytics increasingly growing in prominence is social media analytics (SMA) which is not surprising given the large volume of data and content generated daily in social media. Despite the growing interest, given the vastness of the area, there is little understanding of the topics and issues with respect to SMA that should be investigated by IS researchers. In an effort to contribute to this understanding, this paper in progress analyses SMA trends in research and practice. After searching within nineteen leading academic, practitioner and crossover outlets, we used an inductive approach to categorize the resulting articles. Preliminary results indicate that future IS studies should approach SMA as systems, and adopt a critical stance towards the existing claims that SMA only positively impacts organizations. Results also indicate that ethical-legal implications of SMA should receive more attention. Limitations of the study and plans for the future are highlighted.

%X Practices to create value from personal data in internet-enabled services (IES) remain socially contested. Indeed, the commercial exploitation of personal data violates social expectations and conflicts with individuals’ privacy needs. To explore this tension, we draw on media coverage on IES between 1990-2015. In doing so we examine what, why and to what extent particular business practices have struggled to gain legitimacy. Our findings provide evidence for 1) the power of social control mechanisms in enforcing business practices to match with social expectations, and, paradoxically 2) a fundamental change in these very social expectations in the form of a shift in the dominant institutional logics surrounding IES. By elaborating on the underlying processes of collective assessments of legitimacy in the field of IES, we draw attention to the role of a collective privacy calculus, which might be more salient in shaping flows of personal data than previously expected.

%X While e-business has been playing an increasingly role in facilitating firms to conduct businesses, there is a dearth of research examing the antecedcents and outcomes of e-business use in the entrepreneurial small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). Drawing upon the technology-organizationenvironment (TOE) framework and resource-based view (RBV) of the firm theory, we develop, theorize, and test an integrated theoretical model to evaluate the antecedents and consequences of ebusiness use in the fast growth SMEs context. We propose that IT resources, strategic IT alignment, market orientation, managerial perception of industry environments, and business partnerships are the key antecedents enabling fast growth SMEs to use e-business, and thus help these companies to achieve and sustain e-business value in turbulent environments. Structural equation modeling is employed to test our theoretical conceptualization on a cohort of 310 Australian fast-growth SMEs across different industrial sectors. The results confirm our conceptualization, highlighting the prominent role of IT, strategic planning, culture, managerial skills, and business partnerships in SME success. Our study provides initial empirical evidence to understand the relationship between IT and entrepreneurial SME performance. These findings have important implications for research and business practices.

%X In times of increasing globalization and the continuing growth of internet-based processes and services, it becomes necessary to study emerging phenomena such as user resistance from a novel theoretical perspective. In this paper, we develop measurement instruments to empirically analyze and test why different process participants use or do not use this process in a virtual environment, and why different types of people perceive a virtualized process as useful or usable. We are interested in why people reject or use virtual processes. In order to verify the rejection of virtual processes, we base our research on user resistance and we examine Process Virtualization Theory, service quality and user satisfaction and their impact on attitude towards user resistance. Therefore we conducted a pre-test in the form of an online-survey with 90 participants. The aim of this pretest is to validate our measurement instruments and to get an early understanding of construct validity.

%X This study provides a new perspective to the long-standing debate on the business value of IT. Advancing prior research on the internal perspectives of IT value creation, we take an external view and investigate the role of stock analysts in facilitating the market evaluation of firms’ IT investments. Stock analysts collect information about firms’ IT investments and provide informed recommendations to investors in the financial market. As IT investments are known for their complexity and inherent risks, stock analysts can reduce information asymmetry between the firm and investors in the financial markets, thus helping discovering the business value of IT investments. On the basis of Fortune 1000 firms between 1996 and 2007, our analysis suggests that stock analysts play an intricate mediating role in the stock market evaluation of IT investments. Analyst recommendations have a strong mediating role in the effects of enterprise IT systems (ERP and CRM) on firm market value, but a weak to insignificant mediating role in the effects of function IT systems (DSS, HR and AIS). In addition, we find that the mediating role of financial analysts for IT investments is more salient when the firm’s market environments are more uncertain and unpredictable. These findings suggest that analyst recommendations play a critical role in the stock market valuation of firms’ IT investments in situations where the value of such investments is difficult to assess.

%X Internet and IT have re-shaped the strategy logic of contemporary organizations. The new logic emphasizes business opportunity leveraging through constantly evolving entrepreneurial actions. The required business capabilities underlying such strategic logic, including organizational agility and IT competence, have also to be built and co-evolved. Based on Sambamurthy et al. [1] conceptual framework and ten case studies of Small and Medium sized etailers on third party platform, this research explains what are entrepreneurial actions, enablers of organizational capabilities and IT competence (including IT capability and digital options) for SME etailers, as well as their evolution path and coevolution mechanisms. This research advances the literature by providing empirical evidence of the new strategic logic of internet firms as suggested by Sambamurthy et al.[1], and systematically addresses the adaptive co-evolutionary mechanisms through real options and adaptive learning perspectives.

%X Developing countries in Africa tend to face many challenges when it comes to ICT adoption and use. This is partly due to their low income which makes it difficult to spend on ICTs and related innovations. However, with the proliferation of mobile technology and the newly increase of the middle class citizens who tend to be younger, better educated, and a keen adopter of new technologies; organizations are forced to find ways of understanding these customers better and find how best they can provide goods and services to this emerging class. South Africa, one of the sub-Saharan countries with the most advanced telecommunication network infrastructures of the emerging markets, has experienced an increase in middle class citizens and comparatively better smartphone penetration. With this in mind, one would imagine that South Africa would have been one of the leaders in mobile payments. However, adoption has been lower than most other sub-Saharan African countries. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine the factors that affect mobile payments in the South African context from perspective of the middle class individuals. Following a quantitative approach and collecting data via an online questionnaire, the findings show that trust, risk and habitual use were factors that significantly affected intention to adopt mobile payments by South African middle class citizens. The findings provide the financial services industry and providers of mobile commerce offering with a better understanding of what are the main customer concerns in South Africa from the middle income clientele perspective.

%X This research extends the body of knowledge on SME IT innovation by identifying practical, locally-delivered interventions to assist SMEs to innovate with IT. The research was conducted in two phases over a two and a half year period employing an action research methodology. The diagnostic phase, which has been reported on previously, explored IT adoption factors and provided recommendations to assist SMEs in this area. The local council subsequently delivered a series of workshops and mentoring programs. The therapeutic phase of the research, being reported on here, evaluates these initiatives and provides further recommendations for local interventions. A typology depicting the different phases of IT use by SMEs was developed. Recommendations for local council are presented for each of the phases in the typology. The findings from this study indicate that a tailored approach recognising industry-specific factors is required to facilitate SME IT innovation. The findings also suggest that there is significant scope for local government interventions assisting SMEs with basic IT use and using IT for improving efficiency. However, the area with the greatest potential for benefits through local level interventions is assisting SMEs with IT innovation in terms of developing new products or services and/or different business models.

%X Along with the exponential growth of user-generated content online comes the need of making sense of such content. Online consumer review is one type of user-generated content that has been more important. Thus, there is a demand for uncovering hidden patterns, unknown relationships and other useful information. The focal problem of this research is product feature extraction. Few existing studies has looked into detailed categorization of review features and explored how to adjust extraction methods by taking account of the characteristics of different categories of features. This paper begins with the introduction of a new scheme of feature classification and then introduces new extraction methods for each type of features separately. These methods were design to not only recognize new features but also filter irrelevant features. The experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art techniques.

%X The nature of services and service delivery has been changing rapidly since the 1980’s when many seminal papers in services research were published. Services are increasingly digital, or have a digital component. Further, a large and heterogeneous literature, with competing and overlapping definitions, many of which are dated and inappropriate to contemporary digital services offerings is impeding progress in digital services research. In this conceptual paper, we offer a critical review of some existing conceptualizations of services and digital services. We argue that an inductive approach to understanding cognition about digital services is required to develop a taxonomy of digital services and a new vocabulary. We argue that this is a pre-requisite to theorizing about digital services, including understanding quality drivers, value propositions, and quality determinants for different digital service types. We propose a research approach for reconceptualising digital services and service quality, and outline methodological approaches and outcomes.

%X Crowdfunding gives opportunities to novice entrepreneurs to raise funding for their novel ideas. However, lack of monitoring of projects and funds coupled with the lack of experience of project initiators create high levels of uncertainty for potential funders. In this study, we aim to examine how funders’ decision making process is affected by different types of uncertainty related to the project initiators. Unlike traditional e-commerce where consumers buy a finished product, in patronage based crowdfunding platforms, funders invest in and buy a product that is yet to be finished. This creates a unique uncertainty based on project initiators’ competence. Our results show that uncertainty based on project initiators’ competence and opportunism increase product performance uncertainty. Moreover, the dynamics of project initiator and product uncertainty are affected by the complexity of the product.

%X The importance of service has been a central topic of study regarding consumer behavior and market research. Good services make customers optimistic; subsequently, measuring the pros and cons of consumer vis-a-vis service to form the degree of customer idealism. Service idealism indicates a particular service measured via the degree of optimistic based on personalities. Service idealism is associated with customer preference and influences customer decision toward service providers. This research uses theory of psychological personality traits as the basis to investigate service idealism.  Theoretically, certain factors affect diversification of service idealism. Existing researchers investigated certain related topics in service domain. However, what are the elements of service idealism? Hence, this study aims to explore three questions: (1) how to discover the components of services idealism?, (2) how to use personality psychology to model  the conceptual model?, and (3) how to optimize the service to obtain the concept of services idealism.

%X Although longer reviews are generally considered more helpful, no research has investigated whether “the more the better” also applies to the expression of emotions. This paper explores the distinct effects of review length and emotional intensity. We propose that, in contrast to review length, the intensity of emotions has a negative effect on review helpfulness, and that this effect only applies to positive emotions. Additionally, drawing on elaboration likelihood model and the literature on the social functions of emotions, we predict that the respective effects of review length and emotional intensity are moderated by reviewer trustworthiness and the difficulty of reading review content. To test these hypotheses, we collected a rich data set from Epinions.com - a leading provider of consumer reviews. Our findings reveal the importance of taking the intensity of emotions into consideration when evaluating review helpfulness, and the results carry important practical implications.

%X Top online reviewers who reliably gain consumers’ attention stand to make significant financial gains and monetize the amount of attention and reputation they have earned. This study explores how online reviewers strategically choose the right product to review and the right rating to post so that they can gain attention and enhance reputation. Using book reviews from Amazon and Barnes & Noble (BN), we find that reviewers on Amazon, where a reviewer ranking system quantifies reviewers’ online reputations, are sensitive to the competition among existing reviews and thus tend to avoid crowded review segments. However, on BN, which does not include such a ranking mechanism, reviewers do not respond to the competition effect. In addition, reviewers on Amazon post more differentiated ratings compared with reviewers on BN since the competition for attention on Amazon is more intense than on BN. Overall, reviewers on Amazon behave more strategically than reviewers on BN. This study yields important managerial implications for companies to improve their design of online review systems and enhance their understanding of reviewers’ strategic behaviors.

%X This study aimed to demonstrate empirically that consumers’ attention is related to changes in the electroencephalographic (EEG) brain activity during the observation of a humorous or non-humorous advertisement displayed on social media.  This study is innovative in three ways: first, social media is a popular platform for the testing of pre-launch advertisements.  However, the online environment makes concealing real thoughts easy. Hence, the skill of observing consumers’ actual responses to advertising via brain activity has useful implications. Second, by examining how men and women differ neurologically in sensing humor, this study is a pioneer in testing the interaction effects from an EEG signal perspective.  Third, by using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) methods rather than traditional means, such as correlation, a new lens for understanding neuromarketing might be built.

%X The cost of college textbooks has been increasing steadily for the last two decades. New developments in e-textbook offerings and enhanced features that have made e-textbooks more user-friendly have provided students with an attractive alternative to traditional textbooks. The purpose of this paper was to understand the purchase intentions among college students for e-textbooks. Using Bagozzi’s Appraisal Emotional Reactions Coping Responses theory as a framework, this study conceptualizes a predictive model of students intention to use e-textbooks Study model indicates that Trust, Value, attitude towards the brand and environmental attitudes are key determinants of purchase intentions. E-textbook companies should offer products of significant value to induce purchase intentions. Enhanced student trust should lead to a more positive brand attitude.

%X The goal of this study is to discover the technological, organizational, and environmental determinants for Software as a Service (SaaS) adoption in Indonesian companies. The technologicalorganizational-environmental (TOE) framework was adopted as a primary theoretical lens, combined with five innovation characteristics of Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theory, which incorporated in technological context of the framework. We used a questionnaire to collect data from 147 of Indonesian companies. A logistic regression was carried out to test our hypotheses. The results confirmed that compatibility, observability, market competition, and government have positive relationship with SaaS adoption in Indonesian, while complexity found to be the negative determinant to its adoption. We also found that the organizational context of TOE framework did not contribute to the prediction of SaaS adoption in Indonesian companies. The findings offer valuable insights for researchers of SaaS and innovation adoption, for Indonesian policy makers that want to encourage SaaS adoption, as well as for SaaS vendors that want to develop strategies to persuade companies in Indonesia to adopt SaaS.

%X Social Media have emerged as further source of information for businesses. Data from Social Media have the potential to enable companies in better understanding and serving their customers. This requires the combination of two perspectives – the inside-out view underlying traditional CRM applications on the one and the out-side-in view inherent in the rather dynamic and situation-specific data from e.g. So-cial Media on the other hand. The latter form the basis for understanding customer context, which is explored in this paper. This paper contributes to existing research by developing a customer context model and related information through conducting a structured literature review. It then proposes a matching of Social Media data from Twitter to the model and discusses available data sources of context infor-mation. The overall aim is to support customer-dominant business strategies by building up on the Social CRM approach.

%X Advances in Information Technology (IT) have changed the nature of services, letting it become increasingly digitized. Pro-active services represent a new kind of digital service delivery model promising added value for the receiver of the service who can consume a service without being concerned about its initiation. However, research has provided neither adequate conceptualizations for these novel digital services nor insights into customers’ attitudes and readiness to accept them. To our knowledge, the present study is first in filling this research gap. We provide three metaphors, simplification, enhancement and outsourcing, for different classes of pro-active services. Moreover, we develop a causal model for explaining customer acceptance of pro-active services that is evaluated quantitatively adopting a scenario-based approach for an enhancement service. As an example we choose the readiness of students to accept a pro-active digital service from their education provider. Our findings reveal outcome evaluation as the strongest predictor of attitude. Additionally, attitude is determined by control beliefs and trust. Attitude towards pro-active service affects the customer’s willingness to accept the pro-active service. The presented findings help service organizations in designing pro-actives services that are presumably accepted by customers.

%X There is no doubt that we are living in the mobile age. Massive commercial data from mobile users provide huge potential opportunities for both merchants and researchers. However, compared with Web analytics, how to analyze the mobile data is still under debate. Some companies have adopted similar measurements or metrics to those that have been used in Web analytics tools to depict mobile activities. However, such measurements might bias the interpretation because the behaviors on mobile devices are fundamentally different from behaviors in an online context. Hence, we propose a prototype of an Android-based mobile analytics tool with novel mechanisms for better observing user behaviors in the mobile context, by which the individual behavioral data can be captured at the activity level. The detailed design, such as prototype structure, data structure, specific classes or methods, and sample codes, will be provided. In addition, some potential research opportunities will be elaborated. Furthermore, the practical value of our proposed prototype will be discussed.

%X According to data of Census and Statistics Department, freight transport and storage services contributed to 90% of the employment of logistics sector in the period from 2010 to 2014. Traditional warehouse operations in Hong Kong are labor-intensive without much automation. With the rapid increasing transaction volume through multi-channel, the preference for next-day delivery service has been increasing. As a result, 3rd party logistics providers have realized the importance of operational efficiency. With the advent of Industry 4.0 emerging technologies including Autonomous Robots, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Cloud Computing, etc., a smart robotic warehouse management system is proposed as it redefines the warehouse put-away and picking operations from man-to-goods to goods-to-man using autonomous mobile robots. This paper aims to develop and implement an IIoT-based smart robotic warehouse system for managing goods and autonomous robots, as well as to make use of the autonomous mobile robots to deliver the goods automatically for put-away and picking operations. The significance of the paper is to leverage the Industry 4.0 emerging technologies to implement the concept of smart warehousing for better utilization of floor space and labor force so as to improve logistics operational efficiency.

%X Data stream mining (DSM) deals with continuous online processing and evaluation of fast-accumulating data, in cases where storing and evaluating large historical datasets is neither feasible nor efficient. This research introduces the Multiple Sliding Windows (MSW) algorithm, and demonstrates its application for a DSM scenario with discrete independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. The MSW development emerged from the need to dynamically allocate computational resources that are shared by many tasks, and predicts the required resources per task. The algorithm was evaluated with a large real-world dataset that reflects resource allocation at Intel's global data servers cloud. The evaluation assesses three MSW treatments: the use of multiple sliding-windows, a novel iterative mechanism for feature selection, and adaptive detection of concept drifts. The evaluation showed positive and significant results in terms of prediction quality and the ability to adapt to swift and/or graduate changes in data stream characteristics. Following the successful evaluation, the adoption of the proposed MSW solution by Intel led to cost savings estimated in millions of dollars annually. While evaluated in a specific context, the generic and modular definition of the MSW permits implementation in other domains that deal with DSM problems of similar nature.

%X The convenience and mobility provided by smartphones have made them a preferred mode of conducting many daily activities and various types of applications for these devices have been developed. Apps on a smartphone can be used as a medium for tracking users’ behaviors and collecting personal data about them. The collected data can potentially violate users’ privacy. Many users may acknowledge this but their actions do not support that claim. The seeming inconsistency between professed privacy concerns and the use of smartphone apps may be more a consequence of ignorance rather than irrationality. In this study, an experiment is developed to understand how awareness about the privacy risks associated with the use of smartphone apps would alter the level of the use of apps. Our empirical results support the assertions that awareness significantly increases privacy concerns and reduces inclination to use apps. Implications of these findings are discussed.

%X With the development of the electronic commerce, the electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) has become important reference information of the consumer shopping. EWOM has attracted considerable interest from researchers in the past decade. There are plenty of academics who looked into what factors play the important roles in effect of eWOM. In this paper, a research review is conducted and an integrated framework is proposed on effects of eWOM. The effects of eWOM are influenced by the characteristics, communicators, and other factors. The characteristics of eWOM include the source, the volume and the valence. The communicators of eWOM refer to the sender, the receiver and the relationship between them. In addition, dispersion and consistency, persistence and observability, anonymity and deception, and community engagement are related factors for effect of eWOM.

%X Societal transformation through contemporary online platforms fosters the change of consumption habits. In this regard, sharing economy platforms are changing the hospitality industry by attracting predominately the millennials generation through modern technologies and innovative business models. The given study examines the non-monetary hospitality platform Couchsurfing. In this regard, the authors investigate the influence of trust and perceived risk on the consumers’ intention to engage in a particular sharing activity. The authors further separate intermediary and users from each other to investigate the distinct influence of the two-sided market mechanisms on the consumers’ intention. This study follows a quantitative approach and employs survey data of over 200 consumers. In view of that, the authors conduct an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in order prepare structural equation modeling for an extended study.

%X This paper attempts to develop a public value element model concerning service quality, justice, satisfaction, and trust under e-government context. Drawing upon Moore’s public value model, the updated public value model is constructed, and data obtained from a field survey of 192 e-government users are analyzed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results demonstrate that: (1) public value in e-government includes four elements: service quality, justice, satisfaction, and public trust; 2) service quality and justice (representing services) have a positive effect on satisfaction and public trust; and (3) satisfaction (to measure outcomes) is positively related to public trust. The findings contribute to assessing public value form economic, social and political aspects, and providing guidance for improving public value.

%X Using a unique data set on public cloud infrastructure services consumption by 15,076 firms over the period from March 2009 to October 2011, we address the question of how a provider’s technical support influences cloud demand. The provider’s customers can choose (and switch between) two levels of support, basic and managed, which differ in the extent to which the provider helps customers adapt the cloud infrastructure to their specific business needs. We find that customers who access managed support consume, on average, 110% more IT capacity than those who only access basic support. The former are also 15.5 percentage points more likely to deploy more complex infrastructure architectures that make better use of the cloud’s features (e.g., its scalability). Customers who switch from managed to basic support continue consuming an average of 90% more IT capacity than customers who only access basic support.

%X The Bass Model (TBM), first introduced in 1969, has been used in several fields – including sociology, economics, marketing, and communication studies – to understand diffusion of products and innovations, but has received limited attention in information systems (IS) research and practice. TBM views diffusion as occurring through a combination of innovation (p) and imitation (q). Innovation and imitation describe the extents to which influences external to the population and influences internal to the population respectively affect diffusion. To encourage and enable greater use of TBM in IS research and practice, we describe an application process for using TBM and illustrate potential applications of TBM.

%X Today, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are omnipresent in many parts of the world. They are used for private and business activities. The effects of mobile business are discussed more and more in micro-enterprises as well as in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The question is: Do these devices have an impact on the productivity, flexibility and business processes of companies? The goal of this paper is to develop an explorative model that helps to identify and explain these effects. The investigation is based on a quantitative empirical study conducted among 900 Swiss SMEs. The model is estimated and evaluated using Partial Least Square (PLS) structural equation modelling. The results show that the number of mobile devices used and the portion of work carried out offsite have only a low impact on the perceived value of smartphones and tablets. On the other hand, the impact on value is high if mobile devices support business processes and if the variety of information used is high.

%X A fundamental question in e-commerce field is how to explain and predict sales performance of e-marketplace sellers. We draw on competitive repertoire perspective and strategic group theory to understand the interaction between competitive repertoire and strategic group membership in influencing sales performance over time. To empirically test these relationships, we will collect a longitudinal dataset consisting of seller-month observations on Taobao. We plan to analyze the data using Latent Growth Modeling and Latent Class Modeling. This study contributes to research in three ways. First, it develops and tests the dynamic relationship between competitive repertoire and performance by focusing on the “dynamic” process rather than “static” characteristics. Second, it extends strategic group theory, which has historically been applied to traditional industrial environment, to the e-marketplace. Third, it responds to Chen and Miller’s (2012) call for study on bridging macro strategy perspective and micro action perspective in strategic management field.

%X Information systems designers face great opportunities and challenges in developing a holistic big data research approach for the new analytics savvy generation. In addition business intelligence is largely utilized in the business community and thus can leverage the opportunities from the abundant data and domain-specific analytics in many critical areas. The aim of this paper is to assess the relevance of these trends in the current business context through evidence-based documentation of current and emerging applications as well as their wider business implications. In this paper, we use BigML to examine how the two social information channels (i.e., friends-based opinion leaders-based social information) influence consumer purchase decisions on social commerce sites. We undertake an empirical study in which we integrate a framework and a theoretical model for big data analysis. We conduct an empirical study to demonstrate that big data analytics can be successfully combined with a theoretical model to produce more robust and effective consumer purchase decisions. The results offer important and interesting insights into IS research and practice.

%X This paper explores how uncertainty reduction due to increased forecasting accuracy, which is one of main benefits associated with the adoption of Business Intelligence (BI) systems, will affect the behavior of knowledge workers and how this change in their behavior will impact the appropriation of benefits from BI investments. The study uses a micro-economic model in order to show that higher forecasting accuracy is likely to create the conditions for knowledge workers to behave in a morally hazardous fashion. The result of this behavior is that knowledge workers can appropriate for themselves a relatively larger portion of the firm’s rents from BI investments that should accrue to firm and ultimately to external stakeholders. Studies that measure the payoffs from IT investments that enable more accurate forecasts, such as BI, are likely to underestimate the total benefits by the portion that knowledge workers will appropriate for themselves through their opportunistic behavior.

%X P2P (Online Peer-to-Peer) lending provides an open marketplace where borrowers make requests for loans by lenders who subsequently decide whether to bid or not following an examination of the relevant information posted by borrowers. In this P2P lending context, the leaderboard, where popular loan requests are displayed at the web’s front page, provides information for lenders to use when evaluating the requests. We empirically examine the effects of leaderboard information regarding the most popular existing loan requests. Our results show that the leaderboard information works ex ante in attracting additional bids to get loan requests successfully financed. However, it does not work ex post in improving the performance so that it has less potential for default.

%X The deeper penetration of business-to-consumer e-commerce requires that customer decision support systems (CDSS) serve a wider range of users. However, a significant weakness of existing e-shopping assistance programs is their inability to aid non-professional consumers (non-prosumers) in buying highly differentiated products. This paper proposes a novel framework that infers product recommendations with minimal information input. At the heart of the proposed framework is the feature-usage map (FUM), a Bayesian network-based model that encodes the correlations among a product’s technical specifications and its suitability in terms of its using scenario (usage). It also incorporates a query-based lazy learning mechanism that elicits a product’s rating score from product reviews and constructs its corresponding FUM in an on-demand manner. This mechanism allows the knowledge base to be enriched incrementally, with no need for an exhaustive repository of FUMs pertaining to all possible usage queries a user may invoke. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated through an empirical user study. The results show that the framework is able to effectively derive product ratings based on specified usage. Moreover, this rating information can also be incorporated into a conventional buying guide system to deliver purchase decision support for non-prosumers

Specifically, our work thus contributes to the following research questions: (i) What features should be introduced in the new context of e-commence (e.g. social features)? Which features plays important roles in credit scoring? (ii) How to tuning classification algorithms in an efficient way to avoid model inefficiency? (iii) Do ensemble classifiers real improve classification ability? Data mining methods were adopted in the effort to answer these questions. The testing results indicated that extreme gradient boosting, a novel ensemble classifier, seems to be very adequate to be used for credit scoring of its good performance under imbalanced credit scoring sample. In addition, we also conducted feature importance analysis and enhanced the interpretability of credit scoring model.

%X Online consumer reviews are becoming a key part of choosing a local business, with more consumers than ever turning to the Internet for help with everyday decisions. These reviews can help increase the visibility of the businesses, as well as provide invaluable business development insights for the owners. However, the vast amount of reviews and limited resources can make it difficult for a business to extract intelligence that helps them decide which area(s) for improvement to focus on. Previous studies have suggested that restaurant customer reviews can be categorized into multi-factors such as service quality, product quality, menu diversity, price and value, atmosphere, etc. Consequently, drawing upon eight restaurant review factors from literature and cultural restaurant reviews from a recent Yelp dataset, we propose and evaluate a content-filtering recommender system that automatically classifies individual reviews, predicts the weight and sentiment of each factor in the review, and summarizes the significant area(s) for improvement for each cultural restaurant category. We expect the findings to vary among different culture categories of restaurants. This recommender system helps to automate mining the ever growing online reviews, and provide specific business development insights for cultural restaurants. It is also potentially for other types of business with some modifications on the review factors.

%X Recommender systems are considered as useful software that helps users in screening and evaluating products. The fact that users do not know how these systems make decisions leads to an information asymmetry. Thus, users need to trust if they want to take over systems’ recommendations. Applying social interfaces has been suggested as helpful extensions of recommender systems to increase trust. These are called (Social) Recommendation Agents. While many articles and implementations can be found in the field of e-commerce, we believe that Recommendation Agents can be applied to other contexts, too. However, a structured evaluation of contexts and design dimensions for Recommendation Agents is lacking. In this study, first, we give an overview of design dimensions for Recommendation Agents. Second, we explore previous research on trust and Recommendation Agents by means of a structured literature review. Finally, based on the resulting overview, we highlight three major areas for future research.

%X As a new e-commerce paradigm, social commerce has resulted from consumers relying on the online recommendations of friends and acquaintances. To clarify Chinese consumers’ social commerce intentions, we conducted an empirical study based on a uses and gratifications approach. The results indicate that perceived gratification from entertainment was found to be the strongest predictor of Chinese consumers’ social commerce intentions. This is followed by the perceived gratification from information seeking, expressive information sharing, cool and new trends, and social interaction. However, neither gratification from escape nor passing time was found to be significant predictor. In addition, perceived gratification from information seeking has a stronger influence on consumers’ social commerce intentions in females than in males, while perceived gratification from expressive information sharing has a stronger influence on consumers’ social commerce intentions in males than in females. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in the paper.

%X With the emergence of big data capabilities, as well as legislation leading to the implementation of electronic health records, we find analytics have become a natural extension to our understanding of how organizations can leverage information. Often times, it is the case that a hospital or care provider is capturing more data than it knows what to do with; the market has answered this opportunity with specialty firms that take a provider’s information, and build custom analytics for that provider, based on the provider’s processes, as well as government mandated processes. In this paper, we examine the interposition of the healthcare provider’s data and the opportunity of an analytics firm’s model to gain insights as to how healthcare costs can be lowered from a data-driven process analytics perspective. This research presents the initial findings from case study conducted with a large healthcare provider to define their needs, and an analytics firm to define their offerings. The results will serve as a baseline towards building an understanding of generalizable process analytics that will serve two purposes: 1. Healthcare cost reductions. 2. Patient Suffering reductions.

%X Mobile-internet enabled information and communications processes allow people to share their assets in what is termed the Sharing Economy. Entrepreneurs are reaping huge financial gains but many challenges remain. Many would contend that a business concept such as Supply Chain Management does not exactly fit the definition of the sharing economy. The writer argues that Sharing Economy businesses are mini-supply chains. We should focus more on the communications aspect of demand in supply chains and technology solutions, rather than on a particular application or definition of the sharing economy. Possibilities are endless if we apply supply chain management and sharing concepts to opportunities in the economic, social, and environmental aspects of society.

%X Social media can have enormous benefits for organisations, but a failure to manage how these applications are used can have significant and unintended consequences. In this paper, the authors propose a conceptual Stages of Growth (SOG) Model for managing an organisation’s Social Media Business Profile (SMBP). Following extensive reviews of SOG models in the literature, social media practitioner reports and best practice guides, and industry reported cases of SMBP implementations, the authors propose a conceptual growth model consisting of five stages and the paths of evolution between stages. The authors also suggest 10 benchmark variables by which it is proposed the stages and their dominant problems can be measured and managed. The paper concludes with a discussion of its limitations and the field studies currently being undertaken in 40 small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ireland to test the SMBP SOG model.

%X As a relatively new e-commerce phenomenon, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has the potential to thoroughly change the structure of the loan segment in the financial industry. And the success of P2P lending heavily depend on users’ continuous use. However, this topic has not been fully studied in IS research. The high practical significance and lack of research indicate the importance of the present study. This study aims to apply Meyer and Allen’s three-component model of commitment to construct a research model, which incorporates context-specific antecedents. To test the model, we use a survey of 216 actual lenders of the P2P lending platform in China. Results derived from data indicated that lenders’ continuous investments were jointly determined by continuous commitment and affective commitment. Further, platform assurance, trust on third-party, economic feasibility and quality of alternatives performed well as antecedents of continuous commitment. And perceived critical mass and platform assurance were significantly associated with affective commitment. The results of this research provided theoretical implications for future research and practical implications for the success of P2P lending platforms.

%X Information availability plays an important role in the efficient resource allocation of electronic markets and e-commerce. Most of this information is of qualitative nature containing essential facts that are, however, difficult to decode. Currently, the information processing capabilities of human agents facing such qualitative news is mostly unknown. Accordingly, it is crucial to understand how different decision makers process qualitative information. In this paper we show that sentiment-analysis facilitates research in qualitative information processing. We use a capital market example to demonstrate how investors and analysts perceive novel information. We find that their interpretation is different from one another: investors rapidly translate novel information into transactions, whereas analysts take more time to respond. We further observe that analysts emphasize different parts of information than investors, and are less put-off by complex information. The approach can applied to other electronic markets and the e-commerce industry where individuals react upon textual information.

%X Since its emergence as a new electronic communication media supported by Web 2.0, social media has become a popular means of communication among the public. Among different types of social media that depend on user-generated content (UGC), social networking sites (SNS) are becoming the best-known communication mode. While many researchers have examined significant factors affecting SNS users’ behaviors and their impact on SNS usage, the current research extends the traditional concept of IS loyalty and examines factors impacting SNS users’ creation of SNS loyalty through a lens of social exchange theory (SET) and satisfaction. A total of 291 college students participated in an empirical test. The findings indicate that SET has an effect on creation of loyalty in the context of Facebook, which is currently the most popular SNS. Implications of these findings and limitations of the research are discussed.

%X Via consumer surveys after the “Double 11” promotion, we studied consumers’ consumption behavior and its influencing factors (temporal distance, social distance, product types and purchase decision involvement) based on the CLT and involvement theory with logistic regression modeling. The results show that the effect of temporal distance on purchasing decisions is increasing in high-involvement products and decreasing in low-involvement products, while social distance has a negative impact on purchasing decisions in both high and low-involvement products. Consumers’ purchase decision involvement is reinforced by temporal distance, while is no relevant to social distance. Specifically, when consumers are temporally distant from knowing the promotion issues, their purchase decision involvement tends to be higher and cost more in online promotion. Results provide practical marketing implications and help to enrich marketing theory.

%X E-business models adopted by SMEs are often abstruse and poorly represented, which makes them difficult to evaluate e-business value. This research drew from different theories to create a comprehensive model for e-business evaluation. The study adopted Gerbnerâ€™s theory of communication exchange which posits that by studying the events of the communication exchange, one can infer about the state of the systems engaged in the exchange and their relationships. Consequently quantitative website content analysis of 20 SMEs was conducted to determine their e-business value. The results revealed that most products and services are offered and traded by an SME led by an entrepreneur who demonstrates commitment to the business and is visionary. Also, when there is more technology functionality within the business and its network, connections with other actors are enabled which instigates communication. Lastly, value activity is created when e-business is well maintained and used by employees with intellectual resources. \   \ Keywords \  \ E-business value, SMEs, conceptual model, Southern Africa, quantitative website content analysis. \

%X This research is a conceptual replication of a study by Browne, Pitts, and Wetherbe (2007) that explores information stopping rules in an online search context. Information stopping rules consider the cognitive reasons decision makers determine when enough information is collected to make a decision. Previous research outlines five stopping rules decision makers use and applies them in different decision context. The original research considers three information search tasks (search for a television, map, and job) and hypothesizes the relationship between structure of the task and the stopping rule employed. This research replicates that study in a new information environment with new search methodologies and technology. We find that structured tasks use similar stopping rules to the original study; however further analysis shows distinct differences in the nature of the two tasks presented. Poorly structured tasks potentially involve the use of different stopping rules than previously determined. The updated findings suggest information systems used for poorly structured search tasks might also benefit from highlighting the uniqueness of information in order to encourage a user to continue searching for information.

By doing so, we answer Palvia, Daneshvar Kakhki, Ghoshal, Uppala, and Wang’s (2015) call to provide continuous updates to the research trends in IS  due to the discipline’s dynamism. Second, building on Sidorov, Evangelopoulos, Valacich, and Ramakrishnan (2008) we examine temporal trends in prominent research streams over the last 17 years. We show that, as IS research evolves over time, certain themes appear to endure the test of time, while others peak and trough. More importantly, our analysis identifies new emergent themes that have begun to gain prominence in IS research community. Further, we break down our findings by journal and show the type of content that they may desire most. Our findings also allow the IS research community to discern the specific contributions and roles of our premier journals in the evolution of research themes over time.

%X Many content providers still struggle to establish viable revenue models on the Internet and thus try to tap new sources of income. Using content to drive sales of related products or services such as in affiliate marketing or content-driven commerce appears to be a promising solution for this issue. However, these commerce-oriented revenue models may cast doubt on the credibility of the content, which is an important success factor for the providers. Drawing upon credibility concepts and information processing theories from communication science, we conducted a vignette-based online experiment to investigate whether content credibility is affected by the provider’s revenue model. Participants in the experiment were shown a screenshot of a website, which was monetized either by advertising, affiliate marketing or content-driven commerce. Our results indicate that content credibility in the affiliate marketing scenario was higher than in the content-driven commerce or the advertising scenario. A mediation analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by the content provider’s trustworthiness. Our findings shed light on the relationship between credibility and monetization of content on the Internet. Moreover, they are helpful for practitioners in the media industry in designing optimal revenue generation strategies.

%X Social commerce is a new type of electronic commerce which uses social networks to facilitate social interactions and user contributions. Since social commerce is still in its early development, there is lack of theoretical model to analyze what factors may affect people’s intention to participate in social commerce. The purpose of this research is to propose a theoretical model to analyze user adoption behavior with the consideration of perceived benefit, perceived risk, and trust believes from both commerce and social networks perspective. The model will be empirically tested through an online user survey. This dual-perspective model may also be extended to study user adoption behavior in new types of e-healthcare or e-government system with strong social network connections.

%X Studies of stock market prediction show that stock movements are related to the sentiment of social media. However, few studies have investigated the role of online social relations in predicting stock movements. This paper aims at constructing features that capture users’ online social status and incorporating these into stock prediction models. Online opinions are often developed through interactions and are weaker in their early stages. We developed a feature-enhancing procedure motivated by statistical surveillance approaches to strengthen the ability to capture emerging trends. We evaluated our feature-enhancing procedure by developing models to predict stock returns in the following 20-minute period. A comparison of experimental results with baseline models shows that our feature-enhancing design helped to predict stock movements. The model (SE_CUSUM) that adopted features enhanced by cumulative sum (CUSUM), a statistical surveillance approach, performed better than baseline models in terms of directional accuracy, balanced error rate, root mean square error, and mean absolute error. Our simulated trading also showed that SE_CUSUM realized a higher profit than the baseline approaches. These results suggest that incorporating online social status and our feature-enhancing procedure improve high frequency stock prediction performance.

%X Due to growing hyper-competition, firms need to create digital innovation in order to remain competitive in the digital era. While start-ups are known as a major source of creativity because they use new technologies to develop digital innovations, incumbent firms are beginning to address the opportunities and challenges of digitalization. Against this backdrop, incumbent firms have become interested in collaborating with start-ups in order to create digital innovation in co-development and offer it to customers. However, insights into costumers' subjective stance towards adoption regarding digital innovation that is marketed by incumbent firms and start-ups are absent in the existing research. In light of this, we have analyzed this field based on a qualitative study with 16 interviews with customers. With our results, we contribute to the literature and provide practitioners with valuable insights into how collaboration between incumbent firms and start-ups should be presented to customers of digital innovations.

%X Crowdsourcing contests have emerged as an innovative way for firms to solve business problems by acquiring ideas from participants external to the firm. As the number of participants on crowdsourcing contest platforms has increased, so has the number of tasks that are open at any time. This has made it difficult for solvers to identify tasks in which to participate. We present a framework to recommend tasks to solvers who wish to participate in crowdsourcing contests. The existence of competition among solvers is an important and unique aspect of this environment, and our framework considers the competition a solver would face in each open task. As winning a task depends on performance, we identify a theory of performance and reinforce it with theories from learning, motivation, and tournaments. This augmented theory of performance guides us to variables specific to crowdsourcing contests that could impact a solver’s winning probability. We use these variables as input into various probability prediction models adapted to our context, and make recommendations based on the probability or the expected payoff of the solver winning an open task. We validate our framework using data from a real crowdsourcing platform. The recommender system is shown to have the potential of improving the success rates of solvers across all abilities. Recommendations have to be made for open tasks and we find that the relative rankings of tasks at similar stages of their time lines remain remarkably consistent when the tasks close. Further, we show that deploying such a system should benefit not only the solvers, but also the seekers and the platform itself.

%X The purpose of this study is to propose a data mining approach to predict  the helpfulness scores of online product reviewers. Such prediction can facilitate consumers to judge whether to believe or disbelieve reviews written by different reviewers and can help e-stores or third-party product review websites to target and retain quality reviewers. In this study, we identify eight independent variables from the perspectives of reviewers’ review behavior and trust network to predict the helpfulness scores for these reviewers. We adopt M5 and SVM Regression as our underlying learning algorithms. Our empirical evaluation results on the basis of two product categories (i.e., Car and Computer) suggest that our proposed helpfulness prediction technique can predict the helpfulness scores of online product reviewers.

%X New forms of implicit consumer collaborations in online communities and social networks influence demand preferences as consumers themselves increasingly participate in creating cultural products that both complements and competes with firm offerings. Although research findings on these issues vary, strong evidence from both theoretical and empirical work suggests that the increased technology affordance on the consumer side challenges the profitability of conventional producer strategies that are based on pushing product designs that serve large segments of consumers while ignoring the service of more nuanced consumer preferences. In this study, we present a market design in which producers create and sell original digital culture product and, examine the effect of consumer co-creation in the presence of consumer sharing (piracy) on market performance in terms of consumer and producer surplus and consumer choice. Using the methods of experimental economics, we find strong interaction effects between consumer sharing and co-creation, and, more specifically, we find that consumer sharing interacts with consumer-based co-creation and increases product variety and consumer surplus while reducing producer benefits from co-creation.

%X Privacy and security incidents represent a serious threat for a company’s business success. While previous research in this area mainly investigated second-order effects (e.g., capital market reactions to privacy or security incidents), this study focuses on first-order effects, that is, the direct consumer reaction. In a laboratory experiment, the authors distinguish between the impact of privacy violations and security breaches on the subjects’ trust and behavior. They provide evidence for the so-called “privacy paradox” which describes that people’s intentions, with regard to privacy, differ from their actual behavior. While privacy is of prime importance for building trust, the actual behavior is affected less and customers value security higher when it comes to actual decision making. According to the results, consumers’ privacy related intention-behavior gap persists after the privacy breach occurred.

%X Product ratings have become an integral element of online businesses especially for experience goods, yet seem to be prone to biases that shift most of the distribution towards the extreme points of the scales. Response biases due to inherent traits (such as acquiescence or extreme response style) are widely investigated in survey design and marketing research, yet little is known about how the rating scale variations in user generated product evaluations influence their formation. More precisely, in an experimental study in the context of movie ratings, I show that the use of emotional labels attracts us-ers to the endpoints of the rating scale but their responses are less susceptible to extreme response tendency when the size of the rating scale is increased. Also, simply priming the midpoint of the scale reduces extreme responses, though this effect is attenuated when emotional labels are used. Such ef-fects remain consistent when I account for response styles, cultural dimensions and individual charac-teristics. The broad use of product ratings in generating personalized recommendations and predict-ing market performance necessitates a discussion on how to better account for potential distortions in these ratings due to variations in the rating scale.

%X With the rapid development of science and technology, people’s acceptance of online shopping is increasing. As an important part of online shopping, small and medium-sized cosmetics enterprises have the characteristics of small investment scale and flexible adjustment of brand strategy, but previous research lack sustained and effective methods and tools to analysis brand impact. The paper takes INOHERB as an example, to explore the connotation and feature of brand and brand image from the perspective of the cosmetics online shopping, as well as the relevant theories of online shopping intention. Through literature review, the paper applies the bell brand image measurement model, dividing brand image into corporate image and product or service image, and user image. It also adds the analysis on the consumption characteristics, so as to test result reasonableness of the brand image analysis’s influence on online shopping intention. Data were collected from college female students by print questionnaires and online surveys. The result indicated that corporate image has a strong influence on consumer online shopping intention. Besides, product and service image also have a significant influence on consumer online shopping intention, consumers are more willing to buy cosmetics online above average prices with positive word of mouth and good quality.

%X Due to ongoing digitalization, the traditional business models of incumbent firms are threatened by the innovation performance of start-ups. Therefore, a few incumbent firms have established programs to collaborate with start-ups in order to receive relevant impulses from them. However, empirically, there has barely been any insight into the specific role that start-ups play for incumbent firms. For this purpose, we present the key findings of our qualitative study, which has been built on interviews (n=35) with experts. Our results reveal that incumbent firms and start-ups have equally environmental factors affecting their decision-making in pursuit of digitalization. However, they differ in their technological and organizational factors. According to our findings, we have emphasized that collaboration between incumbent firms and start-ups could be an opportunity to meet the challenges of the digital era. They can build on these identified enabling factors of the partner and overcome their own inhibiting factors.

%X Trust has been recognized as a significant factor in the sharing economy. However, there is still a lack of research that empirically examines the critical antecedents of trust in the ridesharing service, especially in China. Drawing upon Zucker (1986)’s trust building framework, this study develops a theoretical model to examine four antecedents, regarding structural assurance, government support, platform reputation and disposition to trust, on users’ trust beliefs and continuance intention of ridesharing. 307 valid data was collected in one of the largest ridesharing platforms in China, and structural equation modelling method was used to examine the research model. Empirical results suggest that platform reputation is the most significant antecedent of trust, followed by government support, structural assurance and disposition to trust. Specifically, user experience positively moderates the impact of structural assurance on trust, while negatively moderates the influences of government support and platform reputation on trust. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the final section.

Most Fintech firms tend to be platform-based businesses, but yet, the process of Fintech Platform Development has not been studied to a significant degree. Toward tackling this knowledge gap, this research-in-progress paper presents an ongoing case study that is investigating the development of a Fintech platform that provides instalment-based retail services and microloans to students and youths in China. From our findings to date, a preliminary process model is presented that suggests that the process of Fintech Platform Development can traverse across three sequential stages: Value Definition, Stakeholder Empowerment and Co-Evolution. Each of the stages are marked by the employment of various platform development strategies, which in turn, leads to a number of distinct platform configurations.

The author’s research shows that adopting an extended model of UTAUT2 with two new variables, i.e. Risk and Trust will arouse and substantially spread M-Internet and M-Government. Moreover, this paper will assert on the importance of the interrelationship among the main variables of UTAUT2, i.e. the influence of Effort Expectancy (EE) over Performance Expectancy (PE).

%X This paper provides insight into the brand identity elements co-creation phenomenon and explores the effect of co-creation claim on brand identification. The paper also verifies the moderated effect of product involvement and self-construal. The experimental study and the analysis of variance demonstrate that co-creation claim is confirmed to influence brand identification positively. On the other hand, the self-construal moderates main effect of co-creation claim. However, this study suggests that the self-construal and product involvement can not moderate the main effect simultaneously.

%X Digital Transformation has gained great research interest in both academia and practice. While existing literature demonstrates new levels of research interest in the area and how business leaders have engaged in digital transformation journeys, there is evidence of a lack of common understanding of this concept. Both research and practice do not have unified views of the fundamental concepts of digital transformation. To this regard, we demonstrate how a systematic literature review was carried out to conceptualize this phenomenon. Using a concept centric matrix, we discuss the current state of the art literature of the concept by describing it in terms of what it is, the characteristics, drivers, impacts and transformed areas. Inconsistencies in the definition and other factors are identified. Towards a more comprehensible approach to understanding this phenomenon, we argue for the reconciliation of the literature and propose a new general and inclusive digital transformation definition. Avenues for further research on digital transformation of business organizations are also shared.

%X Fueled by the widespread deployment of information communication technologies, the notion of collaborative consumption has become popular in recent years. Traditionally, individuals have viewed ownership as the most desirable way to access products. In recent years, individuals have shown a robust appetite for collaborative consumption. While the prevalence of collaborative consumption activities has significantly affected the industry and the individual, scientific understanding of this emerging phenomenon remains scant. A review of the extant literature suggested that little is known about the motivating and inhibiting factors for participation in collaborative consumption. Building on the benefit-cost framework, this research-in-progress paper proposes an integrated model to explain the influence of perceived benefits (enjoyment and economic reward), perceived costs (privacy risk and security risk), and perceived platform quality on collaborative consumption. The research model will be tested with 300 active users who have participated in car-sharing activity with Uber. This study is expected to contribute to the research on, and practice of, the sharing economy by revealing the factors affecting participation in collaborative consumption.

%X Phishing threatens the information security of Internet users and corporations. Where most research focuses on the phisher’s website, i.e., how to determine if a website is legitimate, this study examines the email that begins the phishing process. To understand why Internet consumers respond to phisher’s emails by sharing sensitive information, we draw on models of e-commerce deception to explain the efficacy of phishing strategies. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a field experiment that manipulated the content of phishing emails. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found content manipulations improved the likelihood of our subjects’ conveying sensitive information. Further, we found that cognitive processes can influence a consumer’s likelihood of being deceived. However, hypotheses about deception support mechanisms and presentation manipulations were not supported. In sum, we find support for the general theory of ecommerce deception as well as our cognitive processing explanations for phishing’s effectiveness.

%X Online review hasalready been recognized as an important sales assistant for consumers to make their purchase decision. However, with the rapid development of electronic commerce,overwhelming informationoverloads and review manipulation make consumers lost in ocean of reviews and face huge cognitive stress. To address this issue, different types of online review have been developed by online marketplaces. Especially, except traditional types of online reviews (positive, neutral and negative), several new types of online review (review with picture and additional review) do not only contain plain text, but also pictures. Consumers could attach additional reviews to the original reviews to further share their experience sometimes later. Few studies have focused on which types of online reviews are able to influence consumers’ decisions more efficiently. Especially, research on new types of reviews is still unanswered.Using data from Taobao.com, the biggest electronic marketplace in China,this study conducts an empirical investigation to bridge the gap. Weinvestigatethat whether and howtraditional text reviewsand new types of reviews influence consumers’ purchase decision making. The results show that under the context of information overload and review manipulation, traditional reviewsare still influential, but less effective than new types of reviews. Although review with picture and additional review don’t show valence directly, they present more reliable references towards product quality and attract consumers’ attention more efficiently.And it is more interesting that new types of online review provide an effective channel for consumers to alleviate their dissatisfaction to effect potential consumers purchase decision making. The findings of this study can provide useful implications for researchers by highlighting the roles of different types of online review in consumers’ decision making. Also, the empirical investigation in this paper will remind business vendors to focus on online reviews especially new types of online reviews and conduct targeted marketing strategies to increase competitive advantage and improve their sales performance.

%X The accuracy of online review mining for e-commerce products is of great value to customer and product matching portrait. Mining the fine-grained aspect in reviews is a key indicator. It can better analyze the emotion tendency of online reviews and understand the advantages and disadvantages of evaluation objects. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to extract product aspects and description of aspects. Specifically, we firstly construct word vector space model of large scale reviews with deep learning, then get the list of similar words based on the model. Finally, the fine-grained aspect sets are obtained by classification algorithm. The results of the study show that the efficiency of fine-grained extraction is improved by using semi-supervised method.

%X Managing firm risk, or firm performance volatility, is a key task for contemporary firms. Although information technology (IT) has been generally viewed as an effective information processing tool that enables firms to better cope with uncertainty, thus holding the potential to mitigate firm performance volatility, evidence to support this view is lacking in the literature. We theorize that enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, a major type of enterprise IT applications, can help reduce firm risk and, in particular, we argue that, to uncover the risk reduction effect of ERP systems, a research focus on the post-implementation stage is needed. Based on a sample of 2,127 firm-year observations, we found that ERP systems in the post-implementation stage were associated with reduced firm risk, and that the risk reduction effect was stronger for ERP systems with a greater scope of functional and operational modules, especially functional modules. We further found that, on average, the risk reduction effect of ERP systems became greater when firms’ operating environments feature higher uncertainty, while the risk reduction associated with fully deploying ERP system modules seem to level off as environmental uncertainty increases. These findings extend our understanding of the business value of ERP systems by shedding light on the risk reduction benefit of ERP systems.

%X Sharing has become a new trend in business that heavily affects the ways how firms do business. Despite this important development, research by now only provides rudimentary insights into value configuration mechanisms applied in the sharing economy. Our paper that is inspired by extant research on value creation configurations as well as recent business model research develops a model of an integrated value network for the sharing economy. We explain that focal firms in sharing economy networks ground their business model configuration in the application of web-based technology. We further point to two dimensions that determine the positioning of the business model: the degree of individualization vs. standardization of the content and the degree of completeness of property rights.

%X This paper presents a formative measurement model for Social CRM technology use from an organizational perspective. The current literature measures the usage of Social Media technologies (e.g., Facebook) and single Social CRM features (e.g., information generation) with reflective indicators, but does not provide a structured approach, which would generate deeper insights into this research field (i.e., formative indicators). To address this gap, the article develops and evaluates formative indicators and corresponding constructs of Social CRM technology use, following the procedure of Moore and Benbasat (1991). To evaluate the impact of single indicators on their corresponding constructs, data is analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis with a survey sample of 122 marketing, communication and IT decision makers. The results show that four constructs measure the use of Social CRM technology (Processing, Communication, IS Integration, and Management), which constitutes the formative measurement model. The construct Processing highlights a second-order construct, including Monitoring and Capturing, Analysis, and Exploitation as first-order constructs. Generally, the developed formative indicators and corresponding constructs generate deeper insights through a control system within a company, so as to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their marketing, communication as well as IT efforts.

%X Never before has IT been so crucial to the success of a service business like in today’s highly competitive environment. Given the huge advancements of information technologies, automation in service processes has become a key design element. At the same time, designers of services must consider the impact of automation on the customer who is typically involved into the service delivery process. In this paper, we analyze customer preference for automation of service processes based on a conjoint experiment in the Unified Communications industry and derive managerial implications for optimal service design. The results show that including higher levels of automation into the design of Unified Communications services is promising both from a customer and a cost perspective.

%X Online reviews are an important asset for users deciding to buy a product, see a movie, or go to a restaurant, as well as for managers making business decisions. The reviews in the e-commerce websites are usually accompanied by ratings, facilitating users to learn the reviews. However, a lot of reviews spread across forums or social media are written in a plain text, which do not have ratings, called non-rated review in this paper. From the perspective of sentiment analysis, this study develops a predictive framework to calculate the ratings for non-rated reviews. The idea behind the framework begins at a couple of observations: (1) the rating of the review depends on sentiment score of aspects as well as the number of positive and negative aspects in the review; (2) the sentiment score of an aspect is determined by its context. Viewing term-pairs co-occurring with aspects as their context, we conceive of a variant of Conditional Random Field model, called SentiCRF, for generating term-pairs and calculating their sentiment scores from a train set. Then we develop a cumulative logit model that uses aspects and their sentiments in a review to predict ratings of the review. In addition, we meet a challenge of class imbalance on calculating sentiment scores of term-pairs. We also propose a heuristic re-sampling method to tackle class imbalance. Experiments conducted on the YELP dataset demonstrate the predictive framework is feasible and effective on predicting rating of reviews.

%X Aesthetics plays a key role in web design. However, most websites are developed based on designers’ "inspirations" or "educated guesses" (Liu, 2003). While perceptions of aesthetics are intuitive abilities of humankind, the underlying principles for assessing aesthetics are not well understood. In this research, we propose using machine learning techniques to explore and more fully understand the patterns and underlying principles of aesthetics. We propose using machine learning techniques to develop predictive models for two aesthetic dimensions – classical aesthetics and expressive aesthetics – as well as for overall aesthetics of web pages in order to evaluate the aesthetic quality of web pages.

We define several constructs, including, inter-organizational IT resources & capabilities, and IT co-creating rents and illustrate a typology of inter-organizational IT resources and their attributes. Finally, we develop a conceptual model of co-creating IT value that integrates the above constructs. Our analysis provides a blueprint to examine the relational rents impacts of inter-organizational IT and motivates research incorporating the RBV and the extended RBV in the field of IS.

Unlike in developed countries mobile media is less popular in developing countries. This study is designed to explore the Sri Lankan consumers’ attitudes towards mobile advertising. The author presents a model of the relationship between demographics and experience with internet advertisements and their attitudes towards mobile advertising. Self-administrative questionnaire was applied to collect data and 413valid responses were gathered. The data analysis results show that, i) Demographics (age, family income) and ii) Experience with internet ads are predictors of attitude towards mobile advertising. Experience with internet ads has significant moderating effect on attitude on m-ads.

%X The first papers on mobile commerce were offered to the Bled conference commencing in 2000. Initially, they were not received with enthusiasm; the reviewers were rather sceptical as to the research methods used and the visions of a global m-commerce offered. Nevertheless, the first panel sessions were overcrowded and the eBled organizers quickly recognized a new and exciting movement taking shape. The rest is – as the saying goes – history. There are around 6 billion mobile phone users in the world but the mobile services in actual use are – besides voice calls and SMS – rather few (at least in comparison to the hype around smart phones). Based on our experience from annual series of consumer studies we argue that there are fundamental misunderstandings in relation to both the mobile service concept and the basis for building user value. By following the development of mobile technology over a 10 year interval we have found out – much to our surprise - that not much has changed in the actual use of mobile services despite the fact that we have had about three generations of mobile phones during these 10 years. We have summarized insight from panels run at the eBled conferences and from a number of papers presented at the conference and worked out a description of the development of mobile commerce and mobile services.

%X “Wow! This is cool!” response is frequently used by young people to express their approval and fond of objects, including digital products and services. Moreover, with the evolution of Internet and information technology, various media have promoted the emergence and development of diverse subcultures among the young generation who have their own lifestyles. ACG (Animation, Comic, and Game) is such an adolescent subculture which is fascinating to a group of young people, named Otaku. Danmaku video sharing website is an important social media for them to communicate, and reflects an obvious hedonic characteristic of usage. As young people are the main adopters of innovative products, when studying young people’s use of technologies, it is essentially important to involve the effect of coolness and subculture. In this paper, we posit that perceived coolness has a positive effect on young people’s use behaviour of Danmaku video sharing website, and ACG cultural identity moderates the effect. We also try to identify the potential quality related factors which can predict perceived coolness. A quasi-experiment is designed to test the research model and hypotheses.

%X How could traditional financial institutions attract online users? Should they mimic their online counter-parts, or compete based on an existing offline business? This research compares different effects of the adoption drivers between pure-play and click-and-mortar e-payment services based on a trust-based Valence Framework. Use intention is proposed to be affected by perceived benefit, perceived risk, and trust, which is in turn affected by familiarity, reputation and security protection. 276 subjects’ responses about Quick Pay (a pure online third-party payment) and Union Pay (an e-payment service offered by a traditional financial institution) were collected. The data analysis reveals: (1) the pure-play e-payment performs much better than the click-and-mortar e-payment except for information risk and property risk; (2) all the path coefficients are significant except the link between perceived risk and use intention for Union Pay; (3) most of the path coefficients for pure-play e-payment service are stronger than those of click-and-mortar e-payment service, except for the links between perceived benefit and intention, trust and perceived risk, and familiarity and trust. These differences can be attributed to different resource endowments owned by service providers. The results suggest that pure-play and click-andmortar e-payment should have different focuses when promoting their services.

%X User’s continuance intention is vital to the future of mobile social apps (i.e. applications) with rapid development and intensive competitions among their providers. We draw on the theory of flow experience and switching cost to build an integrated model to explain factors influencing users’ continuance using intention. Our model is tested by survey and Structural Equation Model (SEM) in the mobile social apps context of Wechat because of its popularity. The empirical results show that: Perceived enjoyment has significant influence on flow experience, and further positively affect users’ continuance using intention; Switching costs exert significant positive effect on continuance intention; Contrary to our hypothesis, time flexibility of mobile devices has no significant influence on users’ continuance using intention towards mobile social apps. With regard to the mediating effect of flow experience, we find that it exerts partially mediating effect between perceived enjoyment and continuance using intention and exert no mediating effect between mobile time flexibility and users’ continuance using intention towards mobile social apps.

%X Co-creating innovations with external stakeholders, such as customers, is gaining popularity among companies as a way to address the competitive and market pressures they face. To this end, research has brought forward a notable number of customer integration methods. The selection of a particular method is governed by various organizational constraints; there is, however, a paucity of research providing decision support for practitioners in terms of when to use which customer integration method. Using the design science approach, our research addresses this research gap by implementing a decision support system to assist practitioners in the selection of appropriate customer integration methods. We elicit requirements from literature and expert interviews, and subsequently design, implement, and evaluate a prototype of the system. Based on identified requirements, the prototype is implemented as a web-based tool (HTML5). The DSS tool aims to acquaint practitioners with use cases and experiences with different customer integration methods.

%X This study utilizes Text Data Mining (TDM) to analyze the contents of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Reports. The goal is to find evidence that environmental sustainability has become embedded in corporate policy and the core business discourse of seven organizations over 2004-2012. Results from supervised modeling techniques suggest embeddedness of environmental qualities in the business discourse.  Unsupervised techniques provide additional support for embeddedness—as business topics tend to increasingly group with environmental ones.  The process we outline should facilitate pattern discovery in documents, minimizing or eliminating the need for time-consuming content analysis that is frequently used in qualitative research. To our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to apply TDM processing to analyze unstructured data from CSR reports.

%X Augmented reality (AR) is expected to be increasingly applied in the design and delivery of products. Most of previous studies have used AR as a research target or context, rather than analyzing the features of AR. By adapting the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics (MDA) framework, this study empirically investigated the influences of game mechanics on game- challenge reactions (dynamics) and playfulness (aesthetics); these influences affected service experience evaluation. A partial least square analysis was conducted on data from 640 users of the game Pokémon GO. The findings revealed that locatability, navigation, and manipulation exert positive effects on game-challenge reactions, whereas navigation had positive effects on feelings of playfulness. Furthermore, game-challenge reactions may influence service experience evaluation directly, or indirectly via playfulness.

The comparisons are conducted in the case context of online services offered by electric suppliers, and the study is based on the data collected from 1,176 consumers through an online survey and analysed by using structural equation modelling (SEM). The findings of the study show that the inclusion of both PIIT and TRI into basic TAM promotes the explanatory power of the model especially in terms of perceived ease of use but also in terms of perceived usefulness and use intention. At the end of the paper, practical implications for electric suppliers and the adoption of their online services are also discussed.

%X Patient-centered e-health (PCEH) represents a fascinating area of digitized stakeholder interactions characterized by complex information flows, shared decision making, co-created value, and mutual interest in improving health outcomes. Such a context lies in contrast to often contentious firm-consumer relationships characterized by self-interest, surplus maximization (from both producer and consumer sides), and consumer segmentation. This article suggests that PCEH is an ideal context in which to study the emerging class of information systems that include consumers as empowered influencers, stakeholders, and decision makers, rather than only “purchasers” on the other side of the exchange relationship or “mandated” users in the enterprise context. The PCEH context is proposed as an enormous research opportunity that may significantly contribute to expanding information systems research and theory.

However, there is a lack of knowledge of what business models prevail in successfully developing and capitalizing an app. This paper aims to investigate prevalent business models. For this purpose, approximately 300 successful apps from the Apple App Store were analysed. Moreover, 10 semi-structured interviews were carried out with app developers who have successfully placed an app within the top charts of the Apple App Store. It is notable that content-driven apps entertaining users in combination with a 'freemium' or 'in-app' revenue model dominate the Apple app market. App developers clearly define their target group, specify their market cultivation, and try to avoid free apps.

%X Whether and how social influence cues can reduce users’ avoidance of sponsored search results (SSRs) remain a puzzling and critical issue in IS research. This study employed an implicit theory perspective to investigate the effects of social influence cues on SSR avoidance. This theoretical perspective suggests that in e-commerce context, SSR avoidance is driven by various implicit theories of consumers regarding sponsored products (e.g., “sponsored products must be of low popularity or quality”). Through a laboratory experiment, we observed a matching effect that a social influence cue could reduce users’ behavioral and psychological SSR avoidance when the cue (e.g., high ratings on the quality of sponsored products) directly addressed the active implicit theory (e.g., a concern on the product quality). In addition, social influence cues could also reduce consumers’ attentional SSR avoidance. This study advances our understanding of the effects of social influence cues on consumers’ judgment and behavior.

%X Online product reviews posted by consumers are becoming a staple part of e-commerce websites. Researchers demonstrate that the volume and strength of online reviews, among others, have a significant impact on consumer responses. These studies have focused on the effect of text-based online reviews, but current information technologies enable the posting of online reviews with higher visual content, such as with images and videos. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Dual Coding theory, we examine the effects of three visual modes for presenting online reviews with three products – backpack, digital camera and video game. Our results indicate that video-based online reviews are perceived as being more credible, helpful, persuasive, and providing a great sense of involvement, compared to text-based and image-based online reviews, but with no significant differences among the latter two. The influence of presentation modes on consumer responses is partially moderated by product type.

%X Consumers are growing increasingly dependent on Online Customer Reviews (OCRs) when making consumption decisions, more so for services due to their intangibility and variability. To this end, we advance a research model that explores how numerical ratings and opinionated reviews, as key constituents of OCRs, affects consumers’ evaluation of service diagnosticity, which in turn enhances the latter’s decision making process. Furthermore, we postulate that consumers’ preference structure will determine the effectiveness of numerical ratings and opinionated reviews on service diagnosticity. Our research model was subsequently validated via a field study that was conducted on a custom developed online restaurant review site. Results suggest that numerical rating and opinionated review can amplify the effectiveness and efficiency of consumers’ decision making process by bolstering the latter’s ability to diagnose a given service. Nevertheless, the effects of numerical ratings and opinionated reviews are moderated by consumers’ preferences for content relevance and self-reference.

%X Consumer data is asset to organizations. Analysis of consumers’ transactional data helps organizations to understand customer behaviors and preferences. Before organizations could capitalize on these data, they ought to have effective plans to address consumers’ privacy concerns because violation of consumer privacy brings long-term reputational damage to organizations. This paper proposes and tests a Privacy Boundary Management Model that explains how consumers formulate and manage their privacy boundary. Survey data was collected from 98 users of online banking websites who have used the system for a minimum of six months. The PLS results showed that the model accounts for high variance in perceived privacy. Three elements of the FIPs (notice, access, and enforcement) have significant impact on perceived effectiveness of privacy policy. Perceived effectiveness in turns significantly influences privacy control and privacy risks. Privacy control affects perceived privacy and trust while privacy risk influences privacy concern and perceived privacy. Privacy concern has a negative relationship with perceived privacy and trust has a positive relationship with perceived privacy. The findings have novel implications for organizations and policy makers.

%X How reviews impact patient choice in health field is still unknown. Patients often worry about their diseases and are eager to find a high skill physician to cure their painful. Traditional hospitals often lack information about individual physician, and with the emergence of online health communities (OHCs), patients can get physician service information on the platform. This study researches the role of reviews in health field and how the roles change with different diseases by collecting data from an online health community. We divide patient reviews into two kinds: online service reviews and offline service reviews based on different services. We find disease risk significantly moderates the relationship between reviews and patient choice: when patients get high-risk diseases, they care more offline service reviews than low-risk diseases. On the contrary, when patients get low-risk diseases, they care more online service reviews than high-risk diseases.

%X Social media technologies are increasingly driving e-commerce activities. The intertwining of social media systems and e-commerce systems are creating new social commerce business models. At the core of these new business models is the need for individuals to upload information. This paper researches individual’s information sharing behaviors in social media sites. With the goal of explaining the factors which drive or inhibit individual’s information sharing, this research integrates factors from the Theory of Reasoned Action and Social capital Theory. Our research model identifies factors which influence individual’s attitude and intentions toward sharing information in social media sites. In addition, by comparing the research results between female and male groups, we discovered significant gender differences in factors that influence information sharing behaviors. Lastly, practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

%X Due to the increased popularity of social networking sites, a new platform called social commerce has emerged. Social commerce facilitates online interactions and user contributions to assist them in conducting commercial transactions. In this study, we rely on risk-return strategy in consumers’ decision making to study drivers and deterrents of social commerce use. We study both purchasing and participating behavior; according, we categorized risk and benefit related to each behavior. We also study trust from two insights: trust toward members and trust toward website. Using survey data from 196 users of etsy.com, we found that trust and benefit are important motivators of social commerce use, and perceived risk is a deterrent factor. Trust toward members reduces perceived risks related to both participating and purchasing behaviors. However, trust toward website does not have a significant effect on reducing risk perceptions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

This paper examines 1,001 ecosystem studies covering sustainable, social, industrial, innovation, platform, and information technology ecosystems. Japanese newspaper entries on 833 ecosystem topics involving successful Green IS/IT implementation are also investigated. Our analysis suggests that Green IS/IT study can be positioned as an important ecosystem research agenda at the intersection of SE and BE. At present, SE and BE are studied separately, and empirical research is fragmented into subthemes.

%X Reputation systems could help consumers avoid transaction risk by providing historical consumers’ feedback. But, traditional reputation systems are vulnerable to the rating manipulation. It will undermine the trustworthiness of the reputation systems and users’ satisfaction will be lost. To address the issue, this study uses the real-world rating data from two travel website: Tripadvisor.com and Expedia.com and one e-commerce website Amazon.com to empirically exploit the features of fraudulent raters. Based on those features, it proposes the new method for fraudulent rater detection. First, it examines the received rating series of each entity and filter out the entity which is under attack (termed as target entity). Second, the clustering based method is applied to discriminate fraudulent raters. Experimental studies have shown that the proposed method is effective in detecting the fraudulent raters accurately while keeping the majority of the normal users in the systems in various attack environment settings.

%X We are living in an era where data means opportunities. New technologies have made it possible to collect and store huge amounts of data. The telecommunications sector, specifically Network Operators, is one of the industries that could benefit from these opportunities. By exploiting this asset, Network Operators could survive lost revenue due to the commoditization of traditional services by other players such as Google and Skype. However, according to information privacy laws, without the permission of their customers, Network Operators have many limitations in using data. In this light, the purpose of this study is to analyze the main factors that affect individuals’ intention to grant permission to their Network Operators to use their personal information, and to look at the differences between smartphone and nonsmartphone users. We used a survey to measure “intention”, “privacy-related attitudes”, and “salient beliefs”; and received 475 responses. The results are expected to have both theoretical and managerial implications. Moreover, these results may suggest to managers which strategies they should focus on to encourage their customers to give permission to use their personal information.

%X Along with the prevalence of microblogging technology, many companies have been creating microblog accounts to promote their products/brands and communicate with customers. However, it is still unclear regarding what factors are critical and can drive users to follow companies’ microblogs. To fill this gap, the present research develops a research model through the perspective of elaboration likelihood model. According to the elaboration level of information processing, we explicate users’ following behavior through three levels of participation: reading messages, forwarding messages, and commenting on messages of companies’ microblogs. We propose that information quality (the central route variable) and source credibility (the peripheral route variable) are two important antecedents in the research model. In addition, we extend the model by considering the role of similarity and examining its impacts on users’ following behavior. We empirically test our research model by collecting data from an existing microblogging site in China. The results show that most of the proposed hypotheses are supported. We thereafter discuss these findings, point out limitations and opportunities for future research, and summarize this study with implications for both theory and practice.

%X Mobile applications and Internet-based platforms continuously foster the rise of the sharing economy business model that can nowadays be found in various industries. In this paper, we focus on potential customers in the ridesharing industry. We use the setting of -˜BlaBlaCar’, a popular ridesharing platform, to investigate the implications of -˜trust’ and -˜distrust’ on the users’ intention to engage in a sharing encounter. In particular, we extend the research model by Mittendorf (2017) which investigates the influence of trust and risk in the sharing economy. In this regard, we differentiate between the platform and the sharing partners, while incorporating both trust and distrust. Our study employs survey data (n = 238) and structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results provide empirical evidence that trust and distrust have unequal effects on the respective user intention, which contributes to the understanding of two-sided market platforms. Academic and practical implications are discussed.

%X As a novel opportunity to acquire capital from the masses, crowdfunding has attracted great attention in academia and practice. So far, little is known about the factors that promote the success of crowdfunding projects, however. In this paper, we examine in how far the social presence perceived on a project’s website influences the success of the respective crowdfunding project. Based on a data-driven analysis of 2.000 project websites from the largest crowdfunding platforms in the U.S. and Germany, we show that the perceived social presence has a significant influence on the success of crowdfunding projects. The obtained results indicate that using socially rich pictures and a socially rich description in the project presentation positively affects the success of a crowdfunding project. A socially rich profile page of the founder(s) in contrast appears to have a rather limited effect. The success of crowdfunding projects seems to be dependent on the participation behavior of the founder, however. Our results indicate that having backed other projects positively influences the success of one’s own initiative. The number of answered comments might have a negative effect on the success of the initiative, though.

%X That recommendation agents (RAs) can substantially improve consumers’ decision making is well understood. Far less understood is the influence of specific design attributes of the RA interface on decision making and other outcome measures.  We investigate a novel design for an RA interface that enables it to interactively demonstrate trade-offs among product attribute values (i.e., trade-off transparency feature) to improve consumers’ perceived product diagnosticity and perceived enjoyment.  We also examine the extent to which the trade-offs among product attribute values should be revealed to the user.  Further, based on the stimulus– organism–response model, we develop a theoretical model that extends the effort–accuracy framework by proposing perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity as two antecedents for perceived decision quality and perceived decision effort, respectively.  In an experimental study, we find that (1)　the trade-off transparency feature significantly affects perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity, (2)　perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity follow an inverted U-shaped curve as the level of trade-off transparency increases, (3)　although users spend more time understanding attribute trade-offs with the trade-off transparency feature, they are more efficient in selecting a product, (4)　perceived enjoyment simultaneously leads to better perceived decision quality and lower perceived decision effort, and (5)　perceived product diagnosticity leads to better perceived decision quality without compromising perceptions of decision effort.  Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how the design of an RA interface can improve consumers’ product diagnosticity and enjoyment, and proposes two antecedents to improve perceived decision quality and reduce perceived decision effort.  For design practitioners, our results indicate the importance of providing the trade-off transparency design feature to potential consumers.

%X The growth of eMarketplaces has attracted interest from researchers in recent years and their low survival rates have also been reported in the literature. The success of some eMarketplaces and the failure of others raised the question as to what factors lead to eMarketplace sustainability. Much of the existing research has focused on transactional cost, supply chain management and hierarchical structure. Applying the theory of service science and value co–creation (both of which have been applied and tested in other business fields) to the study of eMarketplaces, this paper proposes a framework for eMarketplace sustainability. The framework is tested on a dataset of 85 eMarketplaces in Saudi Arabia, which plays a leadership role in information and communication (ICT) development in the Middle East region. Saudi Arabia’s experience with eMarketplaces is expected to influence other countries in the region and beyond. Eight factors were tested and only five were found to be statistically significant in influencing eMarketplace sustainability. The results suggest that service science factors are the major factors influencing eMarketplace sustainability. This paper makes two significant contributions: (1) it provides an initial framework for eMarketplace sustainability; and (2) it enhances the understanding of eMarketplaces in Saudi Arabia, particularly in terms of factors that ensure their sustainability.

%X The emergence of digital innovations is accelerating and intervening existing business models by delivering opportunities for new services. Drawing on the automotive industry, leading trends like self-driving cars, connectivity and car sharing are creating new business models. These are simultaneously giving rise for innovative market entrants, which begin to transform the automotive industry. However, literature does not provide a generic value network of the automotive industry, including new market players. The paper aims to visualize the current automotive ecosystem, by evolving a generic value network using the e³-value method. We define different roles, which are operating in the automotive industry by analyzing 650 companies reported in the Crunch base database and present the value streams within the ecosystem. To validate the proposed generic value network we conducted five preliminary interviews with experts from the automotive industry. Our results show the central role of mobility service platforms, emerging disruptive technology providers and the dissemination of industries, e.g., as OEMs collaborate with mobile payment providers. Scholars in this field can apply the developed generic value network for further research, while car manufacturers may apply the model to position themselves in their market and to identify possible disruptive actors or potential business opportunities.

%X Prior research shows that Social Network Sites (SNS) users who are concerned about personal privacy tend to disclose less information. However, in real-world settings, SNS users often fail to consider such concerns in their actual behavior, such as self-disclosure. This phenomenon is known as the “privacy paradox” where individuals express high concerns about privacy but act in a contradictory way. Several theoretical approaches seek to explain this paradox. This paper extends this research by considering the holistic SNS experience. Drawing on published accounts in the press and prior work on cognitive absorption and privacy concerns, this paper proposes a theoretical framework that helps explain the privacy paradox. Specifically, it emphasizes the moderating effect of cognitive absorption on the relationship between privacy concerns and self-disclosure. Building on the privacy calculus theory, it also emphasizes the effect of cognitive absorption in magnifying perceived benefits and undermining perceived risks leading to increased self-disclosure.

Prior studies explained e-business value creation from net-enabled organizational capabilities perspective, and delivered many insights at firm level with individual-level analysis of capability. In this paper, we posit that competitive advantages under e-business environment will be dependent upon the deployment of multiple types of net-enabled organizational capabilities and their appropriate portfolios. Further, we use Wade and Hulland (2004)’s capabilities taxonomies and multiple cases-based data in Chinese travel and hospitality industry to understand the effect of appropriate portfolios of net-enabled organizational capabilities on competitive advantages.

%X This paper is an evaluation of Enterprise Systems (ES) implemented in Australian organisations in the last ten years. This study is interpretive, addressing the impact of ES on the whole organisation via case studies. The impact of ES was investigated in the organisation both internally and externally addressing both intangible and tangible benefits. The evaluation was based on the Competing Value Approach (CVA) to establish the outcomes of ES on human resource, internal processes, on external opportunities and on management. Major contribution this paper makes to ES theory is that interpretive studies can equally evaluate ES impact, and CVA based evaluation enables the establishment of tangible and intangible benefits both internally and externally. Research presented in this paper is a set of preliminary findings of ES in nine Australian organisations.

%X Empirical studies have repeatedly pointed out that the readability of a privacy policy is a potential source of trust of online users. Nevertheless, many online companies still keep the readability of their privacy policies at a low level. This could possibly coincide with a low compliance of their privacy policies with the guidelines of fair information practices and thus with users’ privacy expectations. Against this background, this study seeks to clarify the role of perceived and actual readability of us-er-friendly and -unfriendly privacy policies in shaping user’s trust in a mobile service provider. Tested for two different mobile service scenarios that differ in the sensitivity of user data (educational enter-tainment app vs. health app), our hypotheses are verified based on the responses of 539 online users. Our findings reveal that in the case of a user-unfriendly data-handling policy, the effect of actual readability of a privacy policy outweighs the effect of its perceived readability in forming users’ trust. At the same time, for a user-friendly privacy policy, only perceived readability plays a significant role in promoting users’ trust in the provider of an educational entertainment app. In a sensitive healthcare context, however, perceived and actual readability of privacy policies are almost equally important.

In this paper, we develop a theoretical model that explores the mechanism through which consumers’ visual-based trust and text-based trust in providers influence their purchasing behavior. We test our model using data from Airbnb.com—a leading sharing economy platform for short-term rental. Using computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing algorithms we extract and code the variables in our model from photos of and consumer comments about hosts in Airbnb.com.

%X Firms need to acquire a wealth of information about job applicants prior to offering employment. However, the recruitment process in most firms is plagued by rising personal privacy concerns. This article draws upon the socio-cognitive theory of trust to understand the interconnected relationships among technology readiness, disposition to trust HR professionals, institutional-based trust and information privacy-protective response. The conceptual model argues that job applicants’ responses to privacy protection is determined by their trust disposition on HR professionals and social networking sites and personalities toward social technologies. The model was tested with U.S. students using a job recruitment related scenario. The results provide an understanding of how job applicants respond to the privacy issue, and shed some light on the role of technology readiness and trust dispositions. This should help human resource professionals improve the recruitment process for hiring employees with perspectives that are consistent with organizational interest and culture.

Europe and North America. Research on ICT impact on socio-economic development has been primarily focused on eastern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Relatively little research has been published on ICT in the Arab world. But better appreciation of the role of Arab culture on ICT use may help in providing guidance for more successful implementation of ICT in the future. To help ascertain this role we reviewed the literature between 2003 and 2016 focusing on ICT implementation in Arabic speaking countries.

%X Nowadays, customers have a variety of options to gather information about products, which can sup-port their purchasing decisions. More and more customers use YouTube reviews or unboxing videos to get a first impression of different products and interact or discuss with other users in the comment section. Automatically analyzing these comments to gain a better insight about the important product aspects remains a major challenge in the field of social media monitoring because the text data is unstructured and noisier compared to conventional review data for example from Amazon. In this study, we focus on the automated aspect extraction task to answer the question, which characteristics of products are important from the (potential) customer view. We show that YouTube comments are a valuable data source for this purpose with an aspect extraction precision comparable to conventional Amazon reviews. To improve aspect extraction in general, we propose a new aspect sorting method based on Google Trends. Incorporating the search volume of products combined with aspects into the extraction procedure improves the precision results especially for noisier text data. To illustrate the analysis results, we choose Amazon reviews and YouTube comments about three exemplary smartphones.

%X China’s latest innovations of Internet Economy are partly reflected in video living broadcast, shared bicycles etc. In recent years, tourism industry in China obtains rapid development by utilizing Internet. However, it is still difficult to meet the growing tourist demands. In order to solve this problem, in this paper, we put forward a Tourism Crowdsourcing Model (TCM), which utilizes the public creativity to meet the increasing demands for personalized tourism. Firstly, the main problems of the tourism industry are analyzed. Secondly, the pattern of TCM is elaborated, and a matching algorithm between the tourist requirements and the workers’ abilities is well designed to find the qualified service providers efficiently and accurately. Finally, an example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the TCM based on shared economy. The results shows that TCM has some significant advantages to satisfy the tourism personalized needs by motivating the public to participate in the tourism industry initiatively.

%X Existing research on recommender systems has mostly focused on developing algorithms to predict the degrees to which a consumer may like a product. Recommended products are usually presented based on their predicted ratings in descending order.  Considering the cognitive process of online consumers, when users evaluate the recommended products in sequence, the descending order may not necessarily be a good solution to increase consumers' willingness to purchase. Drawing upon the evaluability perspective and the order effects theory, we formulate a scenario where each product has two attributes, one of which can be evaluated independently while the other is difficult to evaluate without comparison. Analysis shows that in two out of the three cases of the scenario, presenting the most recommended product in the second place will result in higher consumer willingness to pay. The findings provide a new angle for understanding the behavioral implications of using recommender systems in ecommerce.

%X With the development of information and telecommunication technology, more and more products can integrate such technologies to provide more convenient service to consumers. The connected car is the presence of devices in an automobile that connect the devices to other devices within the vehicles and or devices, networks and services outside the car including other cars, home, office or infrastructure. The data generated by telematics and vehicle infotainment systems is highly revealing of personal lifestyles, habits and preferences include customer account. The purpose of the paper is to figure out effect of social behaviors of connected car on social adjustment as partner, and how this relationship affects determining willingness to provide personal information of connected car consumers. To do so, a research model and the hypothesis have been developed accordingly. The model will be tested by using the sample from South Korea’s care driver. The potential contributions have been addressed consequently.

%X Flexible production technologies like 3D printing give users a large solution space to innovate and design. To harness the full potential of these technologies, it is imperative to provide toolkits, with structured and simplified solution space that meets the needs of users with low involvement. This pa-per explores the manner in which the solution space of 3D printing toolkits is simplified for non-expert users. Toolkit solution space was analysed in 68 toolkits with two perspectives of modularity: 1) Mod-ularity-in-use and 2) Modularity-in-design. First, the solution spaces were categorized in a 2x2 matrix by using the perspective of modularity-in-use, i.e. design questions and design options they offer to users. Second, this categorization and the perspective of modularity-in-design were used to identify mechanisms that simplify toolkit solution spaces. Solution space can be simplified for non-expert users by 1) offering iterative design questions with known design options, 2) using generative algorithms, 3) reusing designs and components from other users and 4) offering ‘meta-toolkits’ for users to create their own toolkits. The meta-toolkits democratize toolkit creation, and simplify solution space for non-expert users, as they design innovative and customizable products, together with expert users, without losing design flexibility.

%X Effective recommendation is indispensable to customized or personalized services. Collaborative filtering approach is a salient technique to support automated recommendations, which relies on the profiles of customers to make recommendations to a target customer based on the neighbors with similar preferences. However, traditional collaborative recommendation techniques only use static information of customers’ preferences and ignore the evolution of their purchasing behaviours which contain valuable information for making recommendations. Thus, this study proposes an approach to increase the effectiveness of personalized recommendations by mining the sequence patterns from the evolving preferences of a target customer over time. The experimental results have shown that the proposed technique has improved the recommendation precision in comparison with collaborative filtering method based on Top k recommendation.

%X Website quality is a critical part of online business. Knowing the factors that influence consumers’ perceptions of website quality allows businesses to more precisely attract and retain online consumers. In order to investigate the cultural similarities and differences between Mexican and US online consumer groups, we employed WebQual. The results of this research suggest that culture affects the consumer's evaluation of some of the web site quality dimensions when differences in corresponding cultural dimensions under study are also present. Of the five dimensions of web site quality, three were perceived similarly between US and Mexican consumers: usefulness, ease of use, and response time. The two web site quality dimensions that were perceived in a different manner between groups were entertainment and trust. In this article, the impact and implications of the results for future research are discussed.

%X The blockchain, the ledger that underlies the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has huge implications for many industries. There have been various papers dedicated to research how blockchain technology will transform businesses and industries. However, current research lacks an overview of what the blockchain implies for the biggest stakeholder of these businesses and industries: consumers. This paper aims to provide an overview of how the blockchain affects consumers. We conduct a systematic literature review and enrich it with interview-based knowledge from blockchain experts to show how blockchain technology changes business sectors, name affected consumers in these sectors, derive implications for these consumers and list existing as well as currently emerging blockchain-based products and services. Finally, we warn of the technical, institutional and human challenges and manifold pitfalls blockchain technology must overcome to gain widespread adaptation among consumers.

%X Cloud computing in recent years has become a popular IT application. In Taiwan, enterprises currently using CRM (Customer Relationship Management) applications seek to take advantages of cloud computing features to enhance CRM effectiveness. However, despite international IT service providers’ investments in Taiwan’s market for establishing a cloud computing environment for CRM users, no statistics are available to reflect experience with actual use. Therefore, the purposes of this study are to understand the satisfaction levels of the current cloud CRM users (i.e., Taiwan’s enterprises) and to determine the key factors, which significantly affect enterprises’ managerial effectiveness and users’ satisfaction with cloud CRM. The basis for the research model is the Information System Success model and the characteristics of SaaS and CRM. This study has obtained contacts with Taiwan’s enterprises currently using cloud CRM, and the complete analyses of valid survey responses will occur shortly.

%X This study examines how three dimensions of electronic knowledge repositories (EKRs), namely customer knowledge level, customer knowledge integration and accessibility of customer knowledge, contribute to increasing customer service representatives (CSRs)’ service expertise and their customer knowledge utilization and acquisition. Furthermore, the study empirically tests the proposition that service quality is influenced by CSRs’ service expertise and their customer knowledge utilization and acquisition. To test the proposed model and hypotheses, data were collected on CSRs working for call centers using EKRs such as knowledge management systems. All the hypothesized relationships were found to be significant except that between customer knowledge acquisition and service quality. Service expertise was strongly affected by customer knowledge level. While customer knowledge utilization was strongly increased by the accessibility of customer knowledge, customer knowledge acquisition was strongly increased by customer knowledge integration. This study offers an insight into how EKRs, which will have been accumulated by firms over time, ultimately influence the performance of CSRs.

%X Although research recognizes the role of IT and organizational agility on firm performance, a research gap to investigate IT-enabled agility at strategic and operational levels exists. In this study, we define operation-level agility as a firm’s ability to respond to market changes or emerging opportunities by quickly modifying its business routines. In contrast, we define strategic-level agility as a firm’s ability to define long-range investment decisions and implement them to accommodate strategic moves and business initiatives. We investigate how IT can empower these two levels of agility, and, in turn, how these two levels of agility can influence firm performance. We also examine the relative roles of the two levels of IT-enabled agility in manufacturing and service settings. We use survey data to validate the proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that, in general, IT leads to superior firm performance through agility at both levels. Further analyses, however, suggest that IT-enabled operation-level agility is a stronger success factor for service firms and IT-enabled strategic-level agility is more critical in manufacturing firms. Our findings provide a theoretical insight regarding the industry-specific values of IT-enabled agility at operation and strategic levels and practical implications for organizational IT deployment under specific industrial settings.

%X IT capability is critical significant to build enterprise agility and promote organizational performance. However, IT capability is always treated as the causal factor already existing and there are few studies on how IT capability is developed. To address this research question, we choose M company, one of the largest fast growing entrepreneurial e-commerce enterprise in China, and conduct a single case study to analyze how IT capability is formed accompanying business’s fast growing. We find that M company has designed and implemented many specific mechanisms in order to tackle the problems caused by business’s fast growing. For a specific problem, what M company has done could be categorized into three periods, respectively pre-event, during-the-event and post-event. M company has obtained an agile IT capability composed of scientific planning capability, improvisation capability and timely feedback capability in the three periods individually by tackling different problems flexibly. We also summarize a process model to illustrate the approach of how IT capability is formed. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

%X Storytelling has been used for a long time as a powerful communication tool. In the time of digital transformation storytelling is rediscovered on online platforms for e-commerce or crowdfunding projects. Digital storytelling is also increasingly used in the social media context, including online blogs, on Twitter or in the form of online reviews of services and products. Across all these digital settings, storytelling is used in order to transport a complex content more vividly to the audience and to ensure that the audience remembers the content as long as possible. In these digital forms of storytelling, textual description is frequently supplemented by digital elements like video, pictures or hypertexts. Recognizing importance of these developments, in this paper we provide an overview of existing studies on storytelling with a particular focus on information systems settings.

%X The vlogging popularity provides a prospective channel for marketers and vloggers to influence viewers’ buying decision. A vlog presents various stimulus that may affect viewers to impulse purchase. However, studies examining the stimulus in the vlog context and how their effects on impulse buying behaviors are still limited. Three aspects, namely vlogger- related factors, task-related factors, and mood-related factors, are identified as the stimulus. These aspects are psychologically processed by perceived enjoyment, perceived usefulness, and parasocial interaction leading to the urgency to buy impulsively. The Stimulus Organism Response (SOR) model is adapted to construct a model in explaining impulse buying behavior in the vlog context. Analysis of 1084 responses shows the urgency to buy impulsively is affected by parasocial interaction and perceived usefulness. Attitude homophily of the vloggers strongly influences parasocial interaction and informativeness strongly influences perceived usefulness.

%X With the rapid growth of e-commerce and user-generated content online, the increasing product online reviews have significant influence on both buyers and sellers. However, among the thousands of online reviews, only the reviews of high-quality matters to the market, thus quality reviews detection rises in response to the requirement of retrieving authentic feedbacks from consumers. In this paper, a state-of-the-art ensemble model, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), is applied to select useful features for quality evaluation of online reviews. Firstly, four types of features are extracted based on information adoption theory. Then, the GBDT model is adopted to select useful features for quality reviews detection. At last, comparative experiments are conducted through online reviews of searching goods, based on two baseline models such as Decision Tree and Logistic Regression, and the results show that GBDT model achieves a better performance in detecting reviews of high-quality. This research indicates that product attributes, reviewer characteristics and objectiveness of reviews are key ingredients in high quality reviews.

%X Gamification has shown to be a valuable approach that enhances participants’ engagement. In education, enhanced student engagement has proven to increase their learning effectiveness. In business, gamification permits employee innovations and helps organizations achieve various business objectives. However, the application of gamification in public services is rather limited. While public service technologies have matured from being informational in nature towards being interactional and transactional, the last maturity stage of e-Government services has not been clearly defined. Accordingly, in this paper we call for “gamifying” public sector technologies such as e-Government systems. We argue that gamification might well be the last transformational stage in the maturity of those technologies. Gamification can play a key role in increasing citizens’ use of public service technologies and, at the same time, make them feel empowered as active participants in their societies.

%X With the advances of Internet of Things (IoT), RFID technology is becoming ubiquitous. While prior studies have conceptualized RFID technology as a unidimensional concept or examined its impact from a homogeneous organizational context perspective, little attention has been paid to RFID technology characteristics deployed in a firm and the extent to which they impact this firm’s network of business partners in terms of relational value co-creation and appropriation. This study draws from relational perspective and Media Synchronicity Theory and proposes a conceptual model relating RFID characteristics – synchronicity, integration capability, scope of utilization – to relational value creation. Specifically, it proposes that RFID impact depends on the direct and combined effects of individual RFID characteristics on relational value. These effects are moderated by the quality of partnership between IT and business units in the firm. The conceptual model validation is necessary to assess the predictive power of the emitted hypotheses.

%X In recent years, firms are making significant investments in online influencer endorsement. The effectiveness of online influencer endorsement and ways to develop effective endorsement strategies however are not clear. In this study, we conduct an exploratory study and empirically test the impact of online influencer endorsement on product sales. Using endorsement information from microblog site, Sina Weibo and sales data from online e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, we found positive impacts of online influencer endorsements on sales and the effect of online endorsement is stronger for influencers with more followers. We also found evidence that frequently endorsing products is counterproductive to the online influencer’s endorsement effort. The results of this study contribute to celebrity endorsement literature and practice.

%X User-generated online content serves as a source of product- and service-related information that reduces the uncertainty in consumer decision making, yet the abundance of such content makes it prohibitively costly to use all relevant information. Dealing with this (big data) problem requires a consumer to decide what subset of information to focus on. Peer-generated star ratings are excellent tools for one to decide what subset of information to focus on as they indicate a review’s “tone”. However, star ratings are not available for all user-generated content and not detailed enough in other cases. Sentiment analysis, a text-analytic technique that automatically detects the polarity of text, provides sentiment scores that are comparable to, and potentially more refined than, star ratings. Despite its popularity as an active topic in analytics research, sentiment analysis outcomes have not been evaluated through rigorous user studies. We fill that gap by investigating the impact of sentiment scores on purchase decisions through a controlled experiment using 100 participants. The results suggest that, consistent with the effort-accuracy trade off and effort-minimization concepts, sentiment scores on review documents improve the efficiency (speed) of purchase decisions without significantly affecting decision effectiveness (confidence).

%X Because of the predominant and rampant of social networking sites (SNSs), users’ information privacy issue becomes an important challenge not only for SNS users but also for the SNS service providers and governing organizations. This study’s objectives are: (1) to study how assurance mechanisms affect SNS users’ self-disclosure intention by applying protection motivation theory (PMT), and (2) to empirically test the perceived privacy concern as part of the PMT in order to predict self-disclosure on SNS. There are a number of expected contributions for this study. First, this study applies PMT in order to understand how assurance mechanisms applied by SNSs affect users to disclose their personal information. Second, we introduce the customizing privacy as an assurance mechanism which has not been studied in previous literature. Finally, we consider fear component of PMT which has not been studied by previous researchers who applied PMT in this context.

%X This paper studies the role of selfie and social interactivity in the effect of product endorsers in social media. Given taking selfie is a self-presentation photograph about people’s private information, we interpret selfie as a high form of self-disclosure. We think this form of self-disclosure can moderate the effect of product endorsers’ attractiveness and credibility on consumers’ attitudes. Meanwhile, as selfie is usually posted in social media like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, the environment of social media also should influence the effect of product endorsers. Towards social media environment, we select social interactivity as one of social media characteristics and propose that social interactivity also can moderate the effect of product endorsers’ attractiveness and credibility on consumers’ attitudes. Then we discuss the methodology and potential contribution of this study.

%X The importance of a well-balanced cross-channel marketing strategy has increased over the past few years. The synergies caused by the interdependencies of different online channels, such as e-mail advertising, search engine and banner advertising, have also drawn the attention of many researchers. However, relatively little is known about the impact of offline marketing, such as TV advertising, on online user behavior. In this article,  a model commonly used in clickstream analysis is extended by adding several TV advertising variables. Based on this model, a hierarchical Bayesian logistic model is developed to estimate the cross-channel effects of both offline and online channel contacts. By applying this model to a case study, it is shown which online channels are most supported by television ads. The findings of this paper have managerial implications for practitioners in the field, in particular because of the increasing use of a so-called "second screen" while watching TV.

%X With the emergence of electronic medical information, mobile health service has been becoming increasingly popular in healthcare. Customers usually have to disclose some of their personal information and preferences for personalized usage of mobile health service. Accordingly, as the negative consequences of the personalized services, consumers’ privacy concern has become an important predictor of individuals’ behavior intention. To address this so called “privacy – personalization” paradox, this study proposes that trust is a key mediator between privacy, personalization and behavioral intention. A survey with 492 subjects in China was conducted to test the proposed research model and hypotheses. The data analysis results show that: (1) Trust is positively associated with behavioral intention; (2) perceived personalization and privacy concern are respectively positively and negatively associated with trust; and (3) trust mediates the relationships between perceived personalization, privacy concern and behavioral intention. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

%X Most people indicate disclosure of private information as a concern but keep revealing personal information in actual behavior. This inconsistency is called “privacy paradox”. Previous literature has proposed a few interpretations of this paradoxical behavior from the rational perspective- privacy calculus. However, individuals are not purely rational decision- makers. They might be bounded by psychological limitations which are often unconscious. Drawing on the dual-process model, this study suggests that the occurrence of contradictory behavior can be explained by the decision-making process people adopted in their actual behavior different from they adopted in their self-report. In many cases, people tend to state their choices after the rational information process even when their behavior indicates they are following their intuition. An electroencephalographic experiment is conducted to capture direct responses when an individual makes privacy-related decisions, further demonstrate that individual’s privacy decision-making process is not totally rational.

%X The manner in which choice is framed influences individuals’ decision-making. This research examines the impact of different decision constructs on decision-making by focusing on the more problematic decision constructs: the un-selected and pre-selected optout. The study employs eye-tracking with cued retrospective think-aloud (RTA) to combine quantitative and qualitative data. Eye-tracking will determine how long a user focuses on a decision construct before taking action. Cued RTA where the user will be shown a playback of their interaction will be used to explore their attitudes towards a decision construct and identify problematic designs. This pilot begins the second of a three phase study, which ultimately aims to develop a research model containing the theoretical constructs along with hypothesized causal associations between the constructs to reveal the impact of measures such as decision construct type, default value type and question framing have on the perceived value of the website and loyalty intentions.

%X A growing focus on sustainability issues has permeated the area of Supply Chain Management (SCM) over the past two decades. The concept of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) has been introduced to reflect a commitment to addressing economic, environmental and social dimensions of sustainability in managing supply chain activities. The transition from traditional SCM to the new landscape of SSCM implies that the roles of IS/IT supporting SCM may need to be revisited as a result of the shift to a SSCM focus. Currently, the role of IS/IT in SSCM has only been discussed in a fragmented manner in a handful of studies. In this conceptual paper, we therefore explore current understandings of SSCM practices focusing on identifying the way IS/IT roles are played out in supporting SSCM practices. We find that SCCM presents a serious challenge to the IS/IT community for leveraging the transformation role of IS/IT that can help increase the adoption of SSCM practices

%X Analysts have estimated that more than 80 percent of today’s data is stored in unstructured form (e.g., text, audio, image, video)—much of it expressed in rich and ambiguous natural language. Traditionally, to analyze natural language, one has used qualitative data-analysis approaches, such as manual coding. Yet, the size of text data sets obtained from the Internet makes manual analysis virtually impossible. In this tutorial, we discuss the challenges encountered when applying automated text-mining techniques in information systems research. In particular, we showcase how to use probabilistic topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet allocation, an unsupervised text-mining technique, with a LASSO multinomial logistic regression to explain user satisfaction with an IT artifact by automatically analyzing more than 12,000 online customer reviews. For fellow information systems researchers, this tutorial provides guidance for conducting text-mining studies on their own and for evaluating the quality of others.

%X This paper investigates how freelancers’ use of signals predicts earnings in online labor markets. Extant literature has questioned the usefulness of some assessment signals to evaluate a freelancer’s quality. We find that conventional signals - signals based on non-verifiable information - can be predictors of higher revenue, when they are based on anecdotes of positive past events (self-promotion). However, mere kindness and flattery towards the customer (ingratiation) is negatively associated with a freelancers’ earnings in OLM. Moreover, we find evidence that the number of tests performed on the platform is significantly associated with higher earnings - with each test that is added to the profile a freelancer-˜s revenue increases by 4.1 %. We base our analysis on a sample of 1065 freelancers using objective financial earnings data, independent codings and survey data.

We focus on curriculum design, program development, and sustainability in business analytics (BA) in higher education. We address some of the burning questions the IS community has asked concerning the various stages of BA program building, and we elaborate challenges that institutions face in constructing successful and competitive analytics programs. Furthermore, given that the panelists have achieved outstanding accomplishments in academic and industrial leadership, we share our experiences and vision of a “dream” analytics program. We hope that our community will continue a dialog that encourages and engages faculty members and administrators to reflect on challenges and opportunities to build dream programs that meet industry needs.

%X Electronic health records (EHR) facilitate integration of patient health history for planning safe and proper treatment. Combined with data analytics, aggregate-level EHR enable examination and development of effective medicines and therapies for chronic diseases. Although promising efforts to implement EHRs are underway, social and organizational challenges plague EHR development and widespread use. These challenges are due to lingering issues such as privacy, interoperability, and security among key stakeholders (patients, providers, and purveyors). Based upon stakeholders’ needs and the issues, we identify two primary thematic areas—integration and analytics—in which the information systems (IS) discipline can contribute to EHRs. Through the accumulated body of knowledge, IS researchers are well positioned and have the expertise to design, develop, and facilitate the use of EHR in the delivery of healthcare. We identify potential research opportunities in each of the two thematic areas that have the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare. We conclude with a recommendation for IS scholars to collaborate with allied healthcare disciplines in order to advance the use of EHR to improve patient care.

%X Under the rapid development of sharing economy, performance is important for the prosperity of this innovative commercial model. However, the performance in sharing economy is less discussed in the academic field. Revenue and occupancy rate are widely applied as two ideal measures of performance in hospitality market. This study tries to fill the research gaps with both two measurements. Based on cue utilization theory, we explored the influence of listing cues and host cues on performance of listings and hosts in a representative Chinese room-sharing platform--XiaoZhu.com. The findings indicate that both listing and host cues have significant effects on performance. It’s expected that this study discusses a number of implications and makes contributions for researchers and practitioners.

%X From the early days of the information economy, personal data has been its most valuable asset. Despite data protection laws, companies trade personal information and often intrude on the privacy of individuals. As a result, consumers feel out of control and lose trust in electronic environments. Technologists and regulators are struggling to develop solutions that meet businesses’ demand for more personal information while maintaining privacy. However, no promising proposals seem to be in sight. We propose a 3-tier personal information market model with privacy. In our model, clear roles, rights and obligations for all actors re-establish trust. The ‘relationship space’ enables data subjects and visible business partners to build trusting relationships. The ‘service space’ supports customer relationships with distributed information processing. The ‘rich information space’ enables anonymized information exchange. To transition to this model, we show how existing privacy-enhancing technologies and legal requirements can be integrated.

%X Among the various online shopping business models, one that specifically attracts the attention of Internet users is “online group buying. which is characterized by group negotiation benefits and online word-of-mouth effects. Extant online group buying research has examined topics covering pricing mechanisms, pricing models, sales performance, and online users’ motivation to participation. Whereas online group buying requires close collaboration among the group buying website, the supplier, the initiator, and the participants, little attention has been paid on the role of the initiator. This study investigates the antecedents of behavioral intention of online group buying initiators from the social exchange theory perspective. The aim is to understand the influence of social exchange factors and the effects of cognitive psychology determinants on the behavioral intention to be an online group buying initiator. This study employed an online survey method, in which a total of 428 valid responses were acquired. Results indicated that self-efficacy, altruism, perceived benefits, and perceived risks significantly affect the attitude toward being an online group buying initiator. Moreover, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and attitude positively affect the behavioral intention to be an online group buying initiator. Further analysis also showed that the experience of being an online group buying initiator plays an important moderating role on certain paths between research constructs. For Internet users who had experience in being online group buying initiators, altruism positively and perceived risks negatively affect attitude. In addition, subjective norm positively influences the behavioral intention to be online group buying initiators for inexperienced Internet users. Besides the discussion of research findings, we offer suggested directions for future research.

%X Driven by advances in information and communication technologies (ICT), manifold business opportunities emerge in diverse industries. In this development, data plays an important role as an essential element of change and economic growth. As a consequence of this development, the analysis of service business models and the role of data in these models has become a focus of interest in practice and research. This paper focuses on international companies that implemented successfully data-driven innovations and aims, in particular, at the analysis of the effects of data-driven innovation on companies’ business models. Based on a multiple case study method, this paper proposes four different transformation patterns: (1) cooperative value innovation, (2) customer-centric value innovation, (3) cooperative productivity improvement, and (4) company-centric productivity improvement. These patterns show that data-driven innovations enable a transformation from product to service-oriented offerings. Furthermore, an optimization of internal and external processes and thus, of the productivity is possible.

%X There is a growing interest in studying the adoption of m-payments but literature on the subject is still in its infancy and no empirical research relating to this has been conducted in the context of the UK to date. The aim of this study is to unveil the current situation in m-payment adoption research and provide future research direction through the development of a research model for the examination of factors affecting m-payment adoption in the UK context. Following an extensive search of the literature, this study finds that 179 relationships between independent and dependent variables have been analysed by 30 existing empirical m-payment and m-banking adoption studies. From analysis of these relationships the most significant factors found to influence adoption are uncovered and an extension of UTAUT2 with the addition of perceived risk and trust is proposed to increase the applicability of UTAUT2 to the m-payment use context.

%X Smart meters are digital electrical meters that offer “two-way, near real time communication” between homes and utilities. While smart meters have the potential to solve our current energy problems, they have also brought new problems regarding the consumers’ privacy. We first develop a measurement model to measure the consumers’ concerns about information privacy in adopting smart meters. Then, we propose a conceptual model to examine the relationship between privacy concerns, trusting beliefs, risk beliefs, and intentions to adopt smart meters. Empirical data were collected from 103 survey respondents and analyzed using CFA and PLS regression techniques. Results show that consumers’ information privacy concerns about adopting smart meters can be measured in three dimensions: collection, secondary use, and improper access. In addition, the effect of information privacy concerns about intentions is fully mediated by risk beliefs. Among the control variables, privacy experiences have a significantly negative effect on intentions.

%X Prediction tools as one type of online decision aid (DA) has gained popularity worldwide due to their facilitating role in consumersâ€™ online decision-making. However, consumers still have concerns about trusting its predictions because of agency problem. One solution is to provide explanation facilities on its interface. In IS literature, more types of explanations other than well studied â€œhow explanationâ€ and â€œwhy explanationâ€ have been called to study. Thus, we propose a new type of explanation facilities (i.e., â€œif not explanationsâ€). Building on prior works in this vein and a classic expectancy view of trust, we develop a theoretical model, which delineates the impacts of three types of explanation facilities (i.e., how explanations, why explanations and if not explanations) on usersâ€™ trusting beliefs via two assessments of DAs (i.e., perceived prediction process transparency and perceived advice quality). An experimental study is designed to test the hypothesized model.

%X The use of professional social networking sites (SNSs) such as LinkedIn has increased rapidly. Retaining existing users, i.e. IS continuance, has become a paramount issue. We argue that current IS continuance literature offers limited value for practitioners such as professional SNS operators. IS continuance literature employs an aggregate view of confirmation, offering a very limited understanding of what performance expectations were fulfilled. We extend IS continuance by adding usability to better grasp the characteristics of the SNS user experience than perceived ease of use currently does. Second, we decompose the confirmation construct into usefulness confirmation and usability confirmation. We have collected longitudinal data from 149 LinkedIn users and used PLS to test the research model. The results demonstrate prior perceived usefulness represents the primary heuristic determining user’s subsequent evaluations of usefulness, whereas usability is influenced more by the confirmation mechanism.

%X Potential backers of crowdfunding campaigns often need to make investment decisions based on limited information, as the project they invest in has not come into existence at the time the campaign is running. As a consequnce, other evidence for the trustworthiness and quality of a crowdfunding campaign, such as popularity information and electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM), are becoming increasingly important. In order to identify interdependencies between these influntial factors and the backers´ decisions, we deploy the Panel Vector Auto-Regression (PVAR) methodology to estimate impulse-response functions that depict the response of one variable to a shock in another variable. Preliminary results from Kickstarter suggest that a positive shock in popularity information is associated with a higher number of campaign backers in the next period. The same is tru for eWOM within the social networks Twitter and Facebook. Despite strong feedback cycles within platforms, our preliminary results show little evidence for cross-platform effects between social media and the number of backers and vice versa. First results show that our current understanding of the impact of popularity information and eWOM on decision making is far from conclusive. We will further validate these findings by extending the dataset, both in time and scope.

%X More South African cell phone users now turn their mobile phones into platform for several financial transactions rather than their personal computers. The penetration of cell phone banking has more than doubled in the past few years. This study provides an update on the earlier study conducted by Brown et al. (2003) on the predictors of adoption of cell phone banking in South Africa. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among cell phone banking users that consisted of students, and workers from various fields of employment. A total of 220 questionnaires were gathered from the sampled population of cell phone banking customers. The data were analysed through partial least square with structural equation as well as regression splines. This article examines the most important predictors influencing cell phone banking adoption in South Africa. The results show that utility expectancy and user satisfaction are playing a determinant role in the adoption behaviour of users in South Africa.

%X Even though information privacy literature has been studying the negative influence of privacy concerns on personal information disclosure, the issue is more complex because often the actual behavior of the individual does not reflect the influence. However, limited explanations have been directed toward examining the contradictory phenomenon between privacy concerns and various subsequent behaviors, the so called privacy paradox. Given this apparent gap, a grounded theory approach is undertaken herein, to improve our understanding of the privacy paradox mechanism and other issues with regard to information privacy. The results of this study suggest that prior experiences of individuals with privacy invasion without actual losses decrease the perceived likelihood of actual loss. Further, privacy concerns impact the perceived likelihood of actual loss. Other factors, such as privacy protective efficacy, privacy apathy, etc, that are related to the inherent role of privacy concerns in behavior are also discussed in the study.

%X Mobile applications (apps) have permeated every walk of our life. This has motivated many companies to jump onto the «mobile wave» and develop specific apps for their products and services. With the growing number of apps, it has become ever more difficult for companies to arrest attention and to motivate users to continuously use the installed apps. A strategy that frequntly is followed is to «beautify» primarily utilitarian apps with hedonic design features in order to increase enjoyment. The current study therefore attempts to understand what effects do hedonic design features have on the usage of utilitarian apps. Our findings show that the implementation of hedonic design features goes along with two effects. First, the general duration how long a user uses an app is increased. Second, there is an inadvertent side effect in that hedonic design features negatively impact the usage duration of an app´s utilitarian functionality. The paper concludes with the discussion of theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

%X The Internet provides large varieties of content, which renders consumption difficult for users. However, recommender systems filter and personalize content according to individual preferences and deliver solutions that take the problem of information overload into account. Previous studies show different approaches to classify existing recommender technologies. Nevertheless, these do not yet integrate social networking information. This study offers a systematic and up-to-date overview of three generations of recommender system technologies, including the latest development of social recommender systems. Also, the study delivers a typology and classification framework with the components of all types of recommender systems and their interactions. Separated between input, process (performed by technology and parameters) and output, we provide an overview to understand and visualize the recommendation process. Our results provide comprehensive insights in current recommender system technologies and are helpful for the design of business models and digitalization strategies.
